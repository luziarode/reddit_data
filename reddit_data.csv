AITA Monthly Open Forum April 2024: Rule 10,"Continuing our deep dive into the rules of the sub, we’ll touch on one that covers a few topics. At first glance, it may appear to be a hodgepodge of just “yeah, put the shit anywhere” but all the components are related.First, we do not permit META posts. Anything you wish to discuss about the sub can be done right here in the Monthly Open Forum. META posts were allowed in the early days of the sub, but there’s not much need for them anymore. Quite honestly, most of the META attempts we see are either people trying to do (what they think is) a clever clapback after a removal/warning, or just observations about the sub. And those can be addressed in the comments below or via [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole&subject=&message=)

Perhaps the most-frequently used part of Rule 10 is regarding updates. As noted, all standalone updates require approval. We do that for a variety of reasons, but the main one is to ensure that the update still follows sub rules. There have been instances where a post was fairly innocuous, but then the update talks about how someone went to prison for murder after the post, or something. I’m being a bit hyperbolic here, but not as much as you may think! We also sometimes see updates that basically say “we haven’t spoken since the post and I’ve blocked them.” That’s not really an update. So we review all updates to ensure all sub rules are still met.

If I may offer a little peek behind the curtain…It’s been interesting being on this side of the sub. Some updates are just wild and violate all kinds of rules. Others are simply heartbreaking to read. And then there are the ones that make you smile. We review all updates as a team though. So if you wish to do an update post, please know that it can sometimes take up to 48 hours to review. If you happen to catch us when several mods are online, you may get a fast response though.

One of the more recent additions to Rule 10, but one that is being leaned into a bit more it seems, is the last sentence. We are not a sub for diary/saga/serial posting. And we have no interest in becoming one. We’re here for the *occasional* conflict you may have. Not to arbitrate every little encounter you may have. If you find yourself having so many issues that you need to post here frequently, you likely need a level of help that we cannot provide, but may be available elsewhere on Reddit. Excessive posting can result in a ban. We do give users a warning, so this isn’t something that earns an immediate ban, but we’ve seen some folk try to use the sub to just post about everything. This has increased in frequency so much as of late, we’ve actually updated our FAQ and are announcing this here - you may submit no more than one post every 3-4 months *at most.*

We'd like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar! If you have any suggestions or additions to this, please let us know in the comments.","['> you may submit no more than one post every 3-4 months at most.\n\nGood to get an actual number on it!', 'How would you like us to report people who posts more than multiple times within 3-4 months. Just press the report button or should we message the mod mail with context?', 'Petition to change NTA to TTA (they\'re the asshole). I see too many instances of NTA when clearly NAH applies. By making it TTA we force people to make a conscious judgment call on who is the AH in a given situation, and I think it would increase the correct use of NAH as a result.\n\nI also think we should implement some ""booby trap"" tags where we give people the option to select tags that are CLEARLY not interpersonal conflict (advice seeking, asking if you\'re an AH in a situation that doesn\'t involve another person etc.) so that a bot can insta-delete them without it getting posted. r/piracy uses this super effectively to completely block any direct requests for pirated content and is very successful.', 'If there were as many incidents in real life of people just leaving children unsupervised at someone else\'s home and then running away to ""force"" that person to provide free babysitting, as there are on this sub, it would be all over the news and declared an epidemic.', ""Modmail. We have limited reporting reasons so that's unfortunately the best we can do there."", 'The sheer amount of times people get reports wrong makes that a hard pass for me.', 'Since the sub has become ""are they the asshole"" by people using ""AITA for getting mad at them for..."", may as well.', 'But that\'s the point of booby trap tags, we can get posters to accidentally flag their own content as not complying with the sub without relying as much on other users to report posts. I\'m a serial reporter for posts which don\'t involve interpersonal conflict and it would save a helluva lot of time and effort to catch OPs by letting them essentially ""report themselves"" at the time of posting.']"
AITA for telling my friend her kid has no manners??,"A few of my (26F) friends came over to our house for a get-together lunch. A few of them have kids and brought them.

One of my friends, Nora (28F) has a 4 year old son (Jack) that is notorious for being naughty. Jack doesn't get along with other kids and is a constant source of crying and screaming. Nora brought Jack over. He said he wanted to take a nap so I showed Nora the guest room and told her to make herself comfortable. Nora came back downstairs after a while and we hung out.

Now, around 40 minutes later Jack came back down and was smiling like crazy. He had my wife's  (Kate - 29F) wedding ring. Kate is a doctor and doesn't take her ring to work. She leaves it on our nightstand. Jack had clearly gone into our bedroom. 

I told Nora I'd like him to give the ring back. Nora said he'd just get bored with it now and that I needed to relax. A few minutes later I asked Jack to please give the ring back. This triggered something because he ran to the window and threw the ring out in our spacious backyard. 

I got really, really mad. Kate adores her ring, and I had it custom made with many little touches. It was extra special because it resembled a ring in Nora's family that she couldn't have because she chose to marry a woman. 

So after all that I told Nora her godd##n son had no manners and she needed to do something about him, maybe take him to a doctor because this is not healthy kid behavior. She got very upset and left. Other guests started leaving too.

Kate and I spent the entire evening looking for it but we couldn't find it. I am a crying mess, Kate keeps saying it's nothing but I know how much she loves that ring. Despite all this every mom in our friend group is calling me an AH for taking it too hard on Jack and Nora. Was I an AH?

And your delivery could have been different. My middle child is autistic with a “pathological demand avoidance” profile. He absolutely would have gone into nervous system overdrive if he had been communicated with directly and with imperative language. His disability is largely invisible to the outside world because he has low support needs and can heavily mask. \n\nIn this situation, I think the mom owed it to her kid to “be his nervous system” and to enforce house rules (don’t touch other people’s shit) in a way he could understand/respond to. (My kid responds well to a declarative style. “My friend looks really upset because that ring is super special to her wife. I think she’d be happy if we respected the rules in her home” and then employed distraction. Failing that, I would have had to grab the ring, triggering a certain meltdown, and left. It’s MY job as a parent to equip my kid for the spaces I bring him into. If I hadn’t properly communicated his disability to you, that’s on me. If I hadn’t scanned for potential issues, that’s on me.

He isn’t being taught boundaries or…well, anything…by his mom. Know better, do better. He knows nothing, so he can’t do any better. If you’d unloaded on her about how she needs to parent and teach her kid, that would have been super valid and fair. But the line about this not being “healthy kid behavior”…it kind of is at 4 if you have no rules or expectations.', 'NTA. Kids need discipline and from your post it seems that Jack lacks a lot of it at home. From the response of the mother when presented with this situation, it can be assumed that that lenient behavior is also shown in the home as well, probably showing Jack that he can do anything he wants because his mother won\'t do anything anyway. She\'s probably a ""he\'s a just a kid"" type of mom and sadly those types of people tend to have children like this. She should\'ve taken that ring from him as soon as she saw it, yet she was more worried about the repercussions with saying no to Jack than helping you.', ""Go get a metal detector to find your wife's ring.

This wasn\'t a cotton ball or a shared toy - kids get weird and fascinated about all kinds of stuff, and 4yos are still learning about patience, taking turns, and sharing. Lots of room for teachable moments. Grabbing an item out of a room he wasn\'t allowed to go in, regardless of the item, is already a boundary violation - and boundaries/consent are important to teach throughout the life cycle. That item being as emotionally and financially valuableas a wedding ring?? And then to lackadaisically blow *you* off for wanting your item back, in your own home, when it was taken from a place he shouldn\'t have been AND without your permission??? \n\nYou were not wrong, and if she continues on this path of thinking she won\'t have to actually teach him about any of this stuff until he\'s ready or whatever? School will be a revelation, as will the fact he\'ll struggle to make and keep friends, and eventually, it\'ll be her stuff he\'s wrecking (assuming that isn\'t already happening) - and what\'ll suck is that he really won\'t understand why things are changing and why people don\'t just let him do whatever he wants whenever he wants. \n\nSo as it comes up again in conversations, I\'d just say you think Jack is capable of better and don\'t understand why Nora can\'t see that.\n\nI really hope you\'re able to find the ring - it sounds like a beautiful heirloom-to-be 🧡', 'NTA. It is your house OP. Your house that you kindly hosted in, made comfortable accommodations for your friends child to have his nap and initially approached the issue politely, with kid gloves.

That is not acceptable and the fact that she really said ""oh he\'ll get bored of it"" instead of just taking it from him? Is she that scared of telling her young child what to do? She should be paying for it to be replaced or renting a metal detector and walking around your yard till she finds it. Unacceptable and those are not friends I would want to have at my home again either. Just a little rant because this seriously bothers me!!!

You wouldn\'t know how good or bad a parent I have been because you\'ve never met me, or my kids (all thriving adults now), or my students (many who took my organizational and life skills classes in HS), or other parents of kids on the Spectrum who I have and currently work with.

The parent has no manners the kid has no manners. OP said MAYBE take him to a doctor. I said, probably doesn’t need a doctor just a good parent.
