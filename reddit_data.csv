Converting PreTax 401k to ??? or what are my options?,"After I left the Navy I started working and putting money in a pre-tax 401k. About a year ago I decided to shift my contributions to a Roth 401k. But still about 90% of my 401k is pre tax. I wish I had done Roth all along to avoid the taxes in retirement.  
  
I am 62 years old, guessing about 2 years from retirement and wondering if I can somehow convert my pre tax 401k funds to my Roth or something similar.  
  
Thanks

Snowbirds with pets.   How do you do it without owning a second home?,"Snowbird wannabe here.   I am hoping for suggestions from active snowbirds who take their pets with them and have experience renting pet friendly accommodations.    I have two small dogs that have to come with me.   I am looking for someplace directly on the ocean that doesn’t charge an extra $100 per night for my two pups.  I can find places on VRBO that are somewhat within price range.   It takes a lot of research to review local leash laws and beyond.   Are there any other sites that will let me filter the results for pets?  I tried a site just for snowbird rentals but it was not navigable for this purpose.   I would love website suggestions because none of the sites I have tried beyond VRBO are useful.  

I want to rent a beach home for three months with my dogs and as long as I can physically drive there, any place within budget is a solid option.   I will consider Mexico if it is dog friendly.    I will be grateful to hear your experiences.   

Also, on VRBO are landlords typically amenable to discounting their nightly rates for someone who wants three months?  

Thanks.  "
"Able to retire, but chose not to do so?","I'm curious if any of you were able to retire, but chose to work a little bit longer and why (for other than financial reasons)? Meaning, financially you could make the jump and be okay but decided to keep working. 

I had planned to come out in a year.. Healthcare would be covered so no issue there. But as the date is coming up, and I'm working remotely and seem to have free time for things I enjoy, I'm now thinking that I'll wait an additional year or two. 

One reason is that my spouse likely won't retire for three more years. So this was would put us on a similar time frame. 

The other is that, though the advisors planned around the approaching target date, I keep thinking that it certainly can't hurt to have another couple of years of income. 

I'm wondering if this is cold feet or logical thinking. 

Retired friends keep telling me that 'you'll know when you know'. Meaning, it will be nice to know that I can retire and there will likely be a time where I say ""I don't want to do this anymore"" and go ahead and step away. 

I'm interested in hearing others' stories regarding NOT coming out at their planned time."
Are COLA added to survivor benefits not yet taken?,"My wife died a few years ago and took her SS benefit about 11 months before FRA (at a reduced value) and passed about four months later. I still have a couple years before reaching FRA and will likely take her benefit in either one or two years when I retire from my current job. My own SS monthly benefit is quite a bit more than hers, so I plan on taking that at 70. 

My question is are COLAs applied to survivor benefits not yet taken? I thought I read that the max survivor benefit would be her reduced benefit rather than her FRA benefit, but are COLAs applied to it for the years between her death and whenever I do take that survivor benefit? My gut says they would be, but...."
The case against the Bucket Strategy,"I've been reading and researching different allocation and withdrawal strategies for retirement savings and the 'bucket strategy' was one that appealed to me. The basic premise as I understand it, is to hold a set amount - say 3 years - of expenses in a low risk 'bucket' and the rest in growth funds. Logic being that you can ride out a bear market with your bucket 1 money and not have to sell stocks at a loss. When times are good, you replenish bucket 1.    


Then I saw a YouTube by Rob Berger and he pointed out that while that strategy may give you peace of mind, you will never be buying stocks at their lows using the bucket strategy. Rather, he advocated for keeping an age-appropriate stock/bond allocation, say 60/40, taking your monthly or quarterly 'allowance' and immediately re-balancing to maintain the 60/40 mix.  When stocks are in the tank, you'll be buying more of them when you re-balance and when stocks are hitting highs, you'll be selling and buying bonds. Basically it will force you into a buy low / sell high program.   


Anyone else just doing a simple rebalance instead of buckets?"
Spending my retirement doing everything I wanted to do. One big item complete.,"So I have been retired for about 3 years now and my goal was to try new things and to keep myself active and sharp by leaning new skills.  When people ask me what my hobby is I tell them I am a skill collector.  I have never been a person to pick one hobby and stick with it.  I like the discovery and learning more than the constant improvement over long practice.

One of my lifelong desires was to write a novel so I decided to jump into it about 9 months ago am proud to say that this week I self published my first novel.  It was an interesting experience and really kept my mind engaged and made every day exciting as I added stuff to the page.

So if you like science fiction feel free to give it a read and let me know what you think.

social security benefits at 62 vs 70,"If I quit working at 62 but wait until 70 to start drawing social security, will the quoted benefit at 70 be adjusted for inflation, or will it stay at the quoted amount. Social security presently quotes $2618 for age 62 and $4785 for age 70. If I wait until 70, will it still be set at $4785, or something like ($4785)\*(1.03)\^8 = $6061.  I'm trying to simulate when to start taking my social security benefits.

How often do you take distributions from your IRA / 401K?,"Spouse (62) is cutting back to part time soon and will still have health insurance. We're going to start taking distributions from one of the 401Ks to make up for the loss of income. (Funny thing is she'll still be contributing to that 401K up to the employer match).,  

But my question is whether you take a set amount from your savings at the beginning of each 2 week period, month or quarter?  Advantages to doing it more frequently would be that the money is invested for a (briefly) longer period of time, disadvantage would be that it's(slightly)  more time-consuming to go online and transfer funds every 2 weeks. Just wondering how most of you are doing it."
"Another notice question, with a twist","I'm getting close to pulling the trigger and starting to consider notice.  I've read a lot of comments about when to give notice, but I'm wondering how much the fact that I'm a federal contractor, in my position for just 6 years, should impact my decision.  I'm leaning toward the standard 2 week notice currently, but interested to hear thoughts on my particular circumstance."
Moving 401(K) providers and want to understand any tax implications,"Hey all, I am in my 50s and need to change 401(K) providers - likely from Vanguard to Fidelity. I also run a small business, so this is specific to the Individual 401(K) plan I have with my wife together with some IRA accounts that we want to rollover.

Here are the specifics:

* I have an individual 401(K) for both myself and my wife with Vanguard
* This 401(K) has both traditional and ROTH plans within it
* We also both have traditional and ROTH IRAs with Vanguard
* At no point will any money for any account in this transfer touch our bank accounts - everything will be provider to provider

I plan to move funds between different types of accounts, as follows:

* Transfer the entire individual trad. 401(K) assets from Vanguard to a similar plan at Fidelity
* Rollover our trad IRAs at Vanguard into the new trad. 401(K) at Fidelity
* Move our Vanguard ROTH IRAs over to equivalent IRAs at Fidelity
* Rollover our ROTH 401(K) assets from Vanguard into our ROTH IRAs at Fidelity (Fidelity does not offer ROTH 401(K)s for small businesses

from what I've read online, it doesn't seem that any of this would trigger a taxable event - and neither will it affect our contributions. I realize this sub does not offer professional advice, but has anyone done anything similar, and are there any pitfalls or possible tax / other implications I need to be aware of?

Thanks for your help!"
Should I work one more year to earn $150 more a month?,"I'm a teacher and I planned on retiring at the end of this school year. I am 65 and this is my second pension.  Our district increased salaries significantly for the next school year.  My pension is based on the highest 4 work years, so working one more year would increase my monthly pension by approximately $150.00.  I'm tired of working, but should I stick it out for one more year?"
Leaving your home city: Was it hard?,"This is a question for those that lived and worked in one city or town their entire life, then after 60+ years or so, picked up and retired to a completely different city or town (like to Florid). I'm 55, anticipating retiring at age 60 after 30 years in my current position, and would love to live near by brother and sister-in-law, but I don't know if I can emotionally detach from the city I've known my whole life. Many people, when they retire, seem to be able to pick up and leave and never look back. If this describes you, how did you do it? Was it hard? What did you do to adjust?"
How do you stave off the feelings of invisibility in retirement?,"A friend and I were just talking about this this morning. It feels to both of us that having an outlet for usefulness is important, or otherwise we get the feeling that we've become useless, invisible, no good to the world anymore. The really satisfying part is identifying some need and doing something to address it, without it becoming something where success is critical to your livelihood. 

Edit: what an amazing variety of replies! For clarity, I’m not searching for suggestions. I’m fully active with volunteer activities, a part time job, and self-care activities. But the discussion with my friend was about what our motives are, why we choose what we do. So I thought I’d ask you. A couple posters opined that introverts tend to retreat from the world, and extroverts still crave connection, and I bet there’s truth in that. I admit I’m surprised how many people equate being visible and useful with having a stressful, demanding job or title, and so they’re running as fast as they can away from that, rather than redirecting that energy to something more serene and joy-giving. We are all different and need different things. "

Just started 5th year retirement. Here's what it's been like.,"So far it's been great. Work was never my life so I don't miss it. I didn't have friends so I don't miss them.

Living in Kansas everything a 1 day drive: the Gulf coast, Colorado, Utah etc. No intrest in Cruises, Europe. Have been to Mexico and Canada however. So far so good. Have everything paid off, takes less money to retire than you think. Go to estate and yard sales for affordable do dads. We all made mistakes in life don't dwell on them."
"No more market slumps as ""buying opportunities""","When I was working full-time, and putting away money into my retirement plans and after-tax accounts, I could always put a smiley-face on long-term market declines by thinking of those times as ""buying stocks on sale"". Now that I am winding down my professional practice, with a corresponding winding down of my income, I no longer have those opportunities to put ""new money"" into the market at reduced prices.  I suppose that the dividends and capital gains in my retirement funds go further when they are used to buy additional shares.  I have two post-tax funds:  I take the distributions from the larger account in cash. That is good, because, on an annual basis, those distributions just about cover my day-to-day expenses. But, since I am taking them in cash, rather than reinvesting them (as I did for thirty years), those distributions are no available to buy stocks ""on the cheap."" On my smaller post-tax account, I do reinvest the distributions, but those are relatively small amounts of money.

Sometimes, when the markets go south for a month or so, I still catch myself reflexively thinking, ""Buying opportunity!"" I then catch myself and realize, ""Yeah, but not for you,"" "
"What's another word or phrase to use instead of ""retirement""?","I'm 62, and will be ""retired"" fully within the year (10 more months).  My hubby is 53 and will likely retire in a couple years.

What bothers both of us is that we feel the word 'retirement' has such a boomer connotation that is negative and (apologies to other boomers, as I'm technically one myself..). We're wondering if there's another word or phrase to use with friends and family that doesn't convey the essence of 'retirement', which many people think about it as being sitting around the house, not doing anything, etc.

We are trying to decide where to live in retirement. How did you  decide?,"We are considering/planning to move after I retire next year. We've already been taking week-long vacations in various potential places, but after the last two, I'm beginning to wonder if that is really helping, as it never feels like ""home."" A week or two is a quick visit and more vacation and quite different from living there. When you were looking to move, how long was needed to feel you made the right choice? Did you make one and then feel it was the wrong one?   

I know many places say to rent before buying.  But to me it has the same type of issues. How long does it take to decide if it's a good match?  Do you keep the original house or move things into the rental to really make it your home?  If we want to try multiple places that seems like a lot of time to invest.    (We can afford do snowbird, it's not about the money but the time and hassles). 

Maybe it will be better to keep our current house (which is lovely) and take longer and longer vacations in winter, but until we have our stuff, it may always seem like a vacation/rental.    If you did that, what was your experience?

"Long term care insurance - good, bad, ugly?","I love r/retirement. The ideas and different views that I have read are an unbelievable wealth of knowledge.  I am 47 & starting to look to the future more closely now. I am retired from the military - read wife & my medical are covered & I'll have a monthly payment for life - & still working. I am curious about long-term care insurance, if you have it and what age did you look into it? If you don't have it, do you wish you did? I have seen the last 5 years of life wipe out a life time of work & that frightens me. It is a gamble, as it may never get used for a variety of reasons. Thoughts?"
Pulling my 401k to buy another house.,"I can't stand it. I lost $2k last week due to stock market volatility. I understand that a 401k is a long term investment, or you make more conservative choices.

Screw that! I can put my money in the 401k, collect the 7% match and immediately pull it out. The joys of working over the age of 60. I think it's kind of actually, a pretty darn good deal.

So I will be pulling out half my money and buying a house. I will keep looking for another one to buy with the remains."
"Finance question, will our budget work?","Am I wrong in thinking our/my retirement will be financially ok? I see people mention massive (to me) amounts in their retirememt/savings accounts. My partner retired almost 2 years ago, and I've decided next year is it. Our only set cost is mortgage & insurance of $1000 monthly.  His pension & ssi is roughly $1900 take home. Mine will be $2200, using my survivors benefit until I turn 67 when I'll convert to my own, and then it will be $3000 monthly. Both of us have an ""allowance"" of $300 monthly in this budget to spend on what we deem  essentials. (For me that's massages & facials!). Both of our pensions cover our health benefits. Our actual cash reserves are roughly $200k.  We do have equity in our home of over $200k as well, and I realize owning our home also makes retirement affordable. Am I wrong? Do I need more in savings? I've seen posts where folks fret because they ""only"" have $500k or more saved, but I can't understand what they plan to spend that money on. We've both have lost a spouse, and believe in living in the present, so have enjoyed our lives now while in decent health, so I don't anticipate a big change in our daily lives. Thoughts?

Update: to clarify, we've lived on a budget for quite a while now. Our monthly expenses, living comfortably, are roughly $2400 a month, including dining out. Our pensions do have COLA adjustments, and we plan to continue private health insurance even when we hit 65. Our social security income will be $3400 monthly so we should be able to set aside $1000 a month for vacations, fun money, etc. I don't anticipate hitting our savings/ 401s except for big hits...but isn't that why we have it? At 67 (or 70 if budget is going well) I'll convert to my Ssi which will increase monthly income by another $800 or more. Sadly, my partners health isn't great, which is why he took early retirement, and why we carried his life insurance from his job forward into retirement.  Medical & life insurance are both paid from pensions & still gives us about $300 each, which is our ""allowance"". Long term, always a crap shoot, aging in place is the goal, but have discussed options with my daughter as well. Partner is a vet, and qualifies for that if needed. I'm trying to live now on the reduced amount & banking the rest to see how accurate my nu bers are..its the impulse shopping I need to work on, changing the mindset from, why not to - is that in the budget? We currently have a jeep, sedan, truck, motor home & scooter..too many toys and slowly downsizing. Vehicles have relatively low miles, are kept maintained, and hopefully will be enough to carry us many years into the future. "
What volunteering gig has given you the most rewarding social connections?,"What volunteering gig has given you the most rewarding social connections? Or intellectual satisfaction?

When folks (like me) mention that they are bored and lonely in retirement, it's very common for other folks to recommend volunteering. I'm up for it! I've volunteered with a bicycle repair nonprofit, a theater, a school, an education program, an animal shelter, and I've yet to come across an opportunity that provides any social connections or satisfying intellectual challenge. I usually feel kind of like a temp, the person who the ""real"" employees ignore while doing the menial tasks that nobody else wants to do, and there's no opportunity to get to know other volunteers. I get that this kind of service can feed the soul, but I also need social connections, and I need to feel like ""I"" am needed because of what I am good at, not just because I have two feet and two hands that work. Maybe I'm volunteering in the wrong places, or maybe I'm asking for the wrong thing from volunteering. What's your experience?"
Time spent in waiting rooms these days,"At the moment, I’m sitting in a regional Social Security office waiting room so packed that there’s a queue outside just to get in to wait. I’m here to submit forms for reducing IRMAA, and I’d rather have someone make sure they’re done right. And I see the same kind of people in doctor’s offices, clinics, pharmacies.

Fantasy vs. reality in retirement: how does yours compare?,"Everyone has ideas of how they'd like their life to be, and some lucky folks can pull that off. Some of us have more resources to be able to do this than others. Some have temperaments or mental health issues that make life challenging regardless of place or phase of life. Some people are more social and can easily find a situation that works, while others struggle to find what they need.

For myself, I had this nutty idea that I could find peace in my retirement, that it could metaphorically feel like a breezy summer day with birds singing. Like things have settled into a good place. (But I'm not dopey enough to think it would be all roses.) While I'm not yet retired (probably this fall), I can see that family mental health issues are going to dog me, and unfortuantely those things affect me deeply. My own struggle to feel balanced will also impact how life feels. Also, my partner and I feel a profound lack of community in a beautiful place NOT known for community. (I mean community by proximity, urban design, or expats- not by trying to make friends by getting hobbies and joining clubs.) And yet, it is hard to picture doing tons of traveling research, finding just what we need, and then being able to adapt to another state or town after 35 years in one city. It just seems overwhelming. Analysis paralysis!

I think many people on this subreddit have far more resources than we do, where traveling a lot or owning two homes can solve some of these problems. That is not our situation. Anywyay, I met a woman in Merida, Mexico who moved there for retirement, and asked how she liked it. She said ""The reality does not match up with the fantasy.""  So, I was curious about the fantasy/reality aspect of retirement for anyone who wants to share."

Housework after retirement?  Is it really retirement for both of you?,"In the last year I left my full time job and began working part time 20 hours/week.  I consider myself semi- retired.  But since my spouse is still working full time, I've taken on almost all the household chores.  I really feel like my work is never done. When the working spouse retires in a couple with a stay at home spouse, does the homemaker spouse just keep doing all the same chores? Do they never get to retire? Or do the two partners then divide the work evenly? I read so many posts talking about how all your time is free now - but how? There's still a lot of labor in maintaining daily life? I'm wondering what the secret is? It it being well-off enough to outsource everything? Is it invisible labor of women?"

Thoughts on Spring - not just today,"From the distance I hear something, a faint sound. As I turn my head toward the dark window , I spy 4:13am on the clock. The noise gets louder, the chirping of an early rising bird. Too soon I think and turnover for more slumber.

Until recently, I would not stir until about 7. But yes Spring is in the air and everywhere. As the sun comes up I take a closer look at the landscape - framed like a picture by the window.

Almost overnight nature has come roaring back. The grass is green and taller in some spots. Too soon to mow? A grey squirrel has caught the attention of my cat and she chatters excitedly. The lone tree seems to have very bright green leaves against the backdrop of a cloudy sky promising rain. Again I see birds there, this time a family of sparrows. 

My mother loved Spring.. Sprouting seeds under grow lights, babying them. On good days , getting dirty cleaning up the beds in the yard. And then the hard work of planting - with a certain hat and her garden shoes on.

Each daffodil I see is a reminder of her and that love. And yet I sometimes get melancholy in Spring as I creep toward the age she and her father left us. In this … beauty and realization , I deeply feel my waning existence.

"Implications of (mini) ""Golden Parachute""?","My institution is offering a full year's salary for relinquishing tenure after this academic year. I wanted to retire anyway, so this seems like an unexpected gift. I know that the taxes will be high, but since I hadn't counted on anything like this, I should go for it, right? 

What might make this a bit more complex is that I was also considering ""phased retirement"", getting half of my salary for half of my job duties. This agreement was going to be in place for a period of three years, but the work I would have been expected to carry out in my second year was so unfavorable that I would have quit after the first year anyway. I could have continued paying into my Roth and my Flexible Savings Account during that time.

My institution pays for my health insurance for life. I have plenty of retirement funding; all the indicators are good. My husband and I are contributing enough into our 403(b)s that we won't incur IRMAA two years down the line, even with this salary boost in 2024.

Consolidating Accounts as part of estate planning,"My wife and are are heading toward retirement and will be updating our wills/estate plans.  We are both quite active and mentally sharp; both have advanced degrees, but my family has a history of Parkinson's and hers of Alzheimer's/dementia, so we want to get things in place now.  Almost everything is joint, but there are a few accounts that are just her name, and my retirement is in mine. We've always had many accounts as she worries about a company going under or someone stealing our stuff, plus the inherent FDIC limits on cash/CDs, so we limited any account to about 250K cash + 1.5M investments.     But she has been watching enough AARP videos not to be as worried about fraud at any of these big players and feels that consolidating to one or two providers would be a good idea.       Personally, I was not worried about many accounts (I document everything), nor did I see the need for many accounts before, so I'll do what makes her happy, but I'm looking for some advice on where to consolidate and if there are any gotcha's to watch out for.   
Trying to balance maximizing our charitable giving and simply doing things to make her happy.  We have more than enough $$, and so while I worry about yields and taxes to maximize charitable impact, she does not worry about money at all.  I may use the Schwab or WF wealth advisors to review our plan to make DW feel it's okay, but I will never put money under active management if I'm alive.  When I pass, the estate will put all of her stuff in super safe/simple TIPS or CD or something for her,  and most of my assets will go to charity, so I'm not worried about that part of management.     
 We currently have assets/accounts at TIAA-Creff (my retirement accounts), Schwab (where I also manage a non-profit account),  Etrade (tax +IRA) ,  Wells-fargo (Bank,CD, Investments), Ally (Bank, CD),  Empower (my 457 and wife retirement), Merril (Wife taxable), Ent CreditUnion (work-related account tied to my work ID + some CDs).   TIAA-Cref has very limited options,  and I expect that when I retire -- if I don't keep going part-time to avoid RMD, then I'll roll that into an IRA at wherever is decided as best.   I might roll most of TIAA over, plus the 457, into an IRA to reduce fees.   
I've never done inter-account transfers or a rollover, but I absolutely want to avoid cashing in investments and paying gains.   Any of these easier to move into/out-of?  Any recommendations on that process or any timing I need to worry about?     Any particular ones to avoid, and if so why.   Any good resources to read?

Advice on selling home to downsize?,"We've gotten rid of excess stuff. Now readying for showing. Those who've been there/done that:

1. Privacy. We get people may open bathroom cabinets/drawers, etc. And even more. How do you maintain privacy? (= thinking maybe putting bathroom drawer items in dark colored plastic bags or similar?)

2. Security. Where do you put confidential paperwork, computers, etc? (We've heard a few horror stories of agents letting their clients roam freely.)

3. Most of our home is furnished based on comfort. Are there a few ""modern"" things we should have so younger buyers don't think ""I'd be moving into my parent's house?"""
Real estate funded retirement - your thoughts please!,"We (M 65, F 59 both still lol working and plan to along as possible) own 3 homes and plan to sell two of them to partially fund our retirement.
We’ll sell home #1 and bank the $500K tax free capital gains plus whatever gains after taxes  into an annuity or other investment account. 
We’ll then move to home #2 ( which we rent out until we occupy it) and live there for 2.5 years - then sell that home and bank the $500K tax free and after tax profits  etc. 
We will add those gains into an annuity or investment and live in house #3 (which we currently operate as a Vrbo)  for our final retirement years.
We do have an extra $400K in 401k, IRAs, etc.
Who else has done this or similar?
We welcome your thoughts & suggestions!
Thank you in advance."
Downsizing in our area seems impossible,"We are in a Portland suburb and have a good amount of equity in our home - worth about $650K-$700K, owe $30K. 4 bedrooms + an office. And while we have done lots of work on it in the 20 years we've lived here, we are on a corner lot with a street behind us that has gotten busier and busier so that opening windows has become almost unbearable and being out back isn't enjoyable. I really want an outdoor space for gatherings and to sit out back and read. So to get that, we are going to have to move, but we like our city and want to stay here for lots of different reasons. 

I thought we (57F and 60M) might downsize while we are both still working FT with a goal of semi-retiring in 1-2 years. But this housing market is just so challenging. Basic 3 bedrooms are going for $500K because a) there are so few of them and b) with interest rates where they are, most people can't afford anything more. Many houses in the $700K-$900K range are sitting. It's just the oddest thing to think that there is only $150K difference or so between our larger and really nice home and a 1980s ranch that hasn't been updated at all. And I'd want to update, so even if we got something for $500K, we'd need to use much of the profits for work on the house and inflation has made the cost of renovating so much higher. I think we're going to have to try to find something equivalent or even go up a little bit rather than downsize, and let go of the idea of pulling some cash out that could have helped us pull the plug earlier than we might otherwise. We only have about $1.3 million saved up and no pensions so every penny counts. Every year the past few years, I kept thinking the housing market would get better but I think I need to resign myself to the fact that there will be no ""cash windfall"" for us from selling our home. Anyone else in a similar situation? I guess I'm grieving in a way - we have to keep working full-time for longer than we might otherwise and just...ugh. "
"Anyone spend winters away from their partner? If so, questions","I know this scenario is unusual, but if anyone fits the topic, would love to hear how you manage a few things. I'm likely to retire in the fall, at 65, and these are the questions on my mind about spending winters away from gloomy Seattle. I have no idea where or how to start. But I do know the spouse doesn't really want to be a snowbird.

* How did you choose your winter locale?
* Did you have to make new friends there? How long did that take? 
* Does leaving at season's end make keeping those new friends difficult, or do things fall into place when you come back next year?
* What did you do to fill your time in the 2nd location?
* Do you have an adjustment period when coming back to your partner?
* If you are not well off, how do you find a place that fits a modest budget? "
"56 years old, Retirement accumulation TIAA-Cref","Hi been with same institution for 27 years. Not a high income earner, current salary is $63k. The retirement plan work is employer 5% to get the employer 9% “match”, which I’ve been doing for the last 27 years. Haven’t been able to contribute more on my end. 

Current balance is $550k. Had an appointment last week with a TIAA financial rep as a “check up” on video chat. 

He explained different ways to “skin the cat.” One way that I found “interesting” was that my 5% contribution can be looked at as a contribution to a pension. So I’ve been 5% contributing to my pension for the last 27 years and accumulating a pension which right now is based on $550k accumulation. 

He said since I’m eligible to retire and married if I wanted to retire now in todays dollars as a hypothetical , my pension based on the $550k would be $39,600 which includes a 100% survivor benefit. However he said if you went this route your account would go to $0 and you and your wife would collect $39,600 for life. He also said the $39,600 isn’t inflation adjusted. He also mentioned the fees etc are very low because of the institution I work. I think he said like $200 a 1/4 with no other fees. 

One thing I didn’t ask is if the $39,600 was fixed or not. 

Any comments on this scenario? Looks appealing.

I am considering moving my brokerage Money Market Account,"I closed my mutual funds about 4 year ago which was a BIG mistake. I got caught up in the news and all the crap that was going on and started thinking that the stock market would crash. As it turned ut the stock market has been doing great the past 2-3 years. I could have earned so much more if I h ad left it in my mutual funds. My little Savings accounts haven't been earning anything, until recently the interest rates have gone up, but I'm sure that won't last for long. . 

I want to take some of that money, which is not a lot, from the  pitiful savings accounts back to a couple of mutual fund or ETF fund, maybe go with an Index 500 fund. Do you think it would be a mistake to trade my risk free savings into mutual funds today? I am 68, retired, and living on SS?"
Thoughts on my journey to retirement in Mexico,"I was asked in another post to detail some of my retirement journey- specifically why and how we ended up in Mexico.
I’d like to start by acknowledging that because of a fairly high income job for the last 30+ years, we were able to make this work and retire 5-6 years early at 59.  However, we couldn’t have done this without a lot of planning and buckling down on our spending, even with a good income. We were basically spending what we earned for 20 years, and while we did max out our retirement funds every year, we saved virtually nothing during that time.

A little background.  I worked in a high stress job with long hours and chronic sleep deprivation. At the 20 year mark I was depressed, burned out and disengaged. Basically -done.  But there was no way to walk away at that point.  So we sat down and brainstormed.  We discovered we could live well and a lot more cheaply in many other countries.  So, we decided to work toward early retirement somewhere else.

From that day on, we saved a huge chunk of every paycheck, didn’t buy much and examined every purchase- want vs. need. Turns out you don’t need that much. Our only major expenses were yearly trips to areas we were considering moving to.

We identified 4 countries and vacationed in those places over 10 years.  Trying at each place to “live like a local”. Shopped and cooked like a local, investigated costs, health care and ease of going back to US to see our kids. Talked to lots of people in those places.  

Bottom line- we were very intentional about every decision from that point on. With the goal being- get out.

We reached the ten year mark and were scared to pull the trigger, until a health scare jolted us back into reality.  At this point we were surrounded by people telling us we were crazy, so we  really had no external support.

I put in my notice and we started downsizing. I could write a book about this painful stage in the journey. Let’s just say it was brutal and there were a lot of tears and second guessing ourselves.

We had settled on Mexico as our destination, and we arrived here with 3 suitcases, 7 months ago.  Best decision of our lives.  We are loving living here in this vibrant, noisy, friendly, beautiful country.  We did make a second trip to bring down a car, but as we hardly use it, we will most likely get rid of it. 

We are making every effort to integrate into the culture here, and it has been equal parts hilarious and heartwarming.  We consider ourselves immigrants, not expats.  Every day is an adventure and a gift.   Thanks for reading!  Writing this out was very therapeutic.

TL:DR

We retired early in Mexico and we love it!

completed first 100 days. How are other recent retirees doing?,"I'm writing up my accomplishments for first quarter retirement performance review. I skied 15 days, biked 10 days, swam 7 times, did walk to run 6 times, and did 4 day hikes. I didn't count walking and stretching.

This quarter I am focusing on training for a sprint triathlon and tackling some home/auto/landscaping maintenance things. Also going to visit my folks.

Spouse is still working and has been cutting me some slack but I suspect they will want to have more input into my position description and performance elements for next FY. I think I can manage/meet expectations with a couple of appliance replacements, a car donation, and some yard work. 


One of my main goals was to NOT check the stock market for three months and I succeeded!


Looking to get into more of a daily/weekly routine with some decluttering, running, swimming, and then biking on the weekends with my spouse. 


No desire to go back to work so far.

How are other recent retirees doing?"
Wife wants to move and husband does not,"I (64F) retired in December 2019 and husband (63M) shut down his business December 2023. We live in a HCOL area that is getting more crowded, higher crime and more noise and air pollution. 

I hate it here but husband does not want to move. Has anyone been in a similar situation and if so, were you able to resolve it so that both parties were happy? "
Going from extreme saving mindset to spending for a good life,"I retired literally on the day before the US stock and bond markets began to tank in 2022. So starting my retirement while watching the value of my portfolio go down and down and down while inflation went up and up and up was difficult. I had a budget and a plan and reassurances from an advisor but I nevertheless spent $60K less than I'd planned to in those first two years because I was so worried about sequence of returns issues.

Now the markets are back up and inflation is back down and I'm taking baby steps to spending on things beyond keeping the lights on. I had a water softener installed. I bought the first really good audio system I've ever owned. I'm planning a trip in the fall. Between the austerity budgeting of the past two years and the recovery of my portfolio I'm still below the amount I've been greenlit to spend. Advisor says to spend money because I'm doing fine and will regret it in later decades when I'll have less mobility. I know he's right.

It's a good feeling to finally be doing these things but I can't shake the nagging feeling that I'm being extravagant and I'll be sorry when the markets tank again, which of course they will because thats what markets do. No plan is bulletproof but what I've seen over two years is that I'm capable of living on a lot less than even my ""needs"" budget.

How do you all handle making this transition from working saver to retired spender so you can actually enjoy the fruits of you discipline and frugality?

I'm not interested in talking about percentages or amounts or LT care risks or leaving behind assets for others. I am comfortable with my plan, my investment strategy and my goals. This is about the How of doing a 180 from saving to spending."
Are there groups like SCORE folur non-executives?,Service Corp of Retired Executives is a volunteer group where former execs can give back- typically to start ups or non profits.  Are there any groups with a similar mission where non executives can contribute?  I only got to middle management level and have been in leadership roles most of my career- I don't want a JOB job but would like a volunteer role to feel useful and work with other motivated folks.
Did not expect the days to fly by so fast,"I (66m) retired officially March 1. I had been on family leave since December to care for my dying son at a hospice. I basically lived there. He was a firefighter who fell in line of duty. To experience something like this, brings in many changes in thinking. It’s like a crucible that burns away things that don’t matter anymore. The day before he passed, I called work and informed them I would not be coming back. I gave them a month’s notice and spent time tying off loose ends.  
Retirement is pretty awesome, I have lots of interests and hobbies to keep me busy, design & make things,  I have a vintage car which always needs my time, astronomy, travel, a wife who has lots for me to do. I really focus on trying to be the man she thought she married. With work out of the way, I can think clearly about that now. I have time to slowly process my son, as parts of my mind which hid from this, are gradually waking up to think about it. This would be hard/unhealthy to do while working the job I had.  
A few things I notice:  
- The days are going by very fast, I get up, do a few things and suddenly it’s evening.  
- I am not in a hurry to complete projects. There’s always a feeling that I can work on it more tomorrow.  
- I am more even-tempered. This could be either the removal of stress from work or part of an epiphany from the experience with my son. I do not know which. But I am definitely less stressed.  
- My body wants to gain weight. I am fighting back, avoiding snacks and tragically, stopped drinking. Again, the stress or working was favorable in terms of keeping my weight down. I have to get into an exercise regime.  
That’s it for now. I have to get busy doing nothing now.

=================

EDIT:

Thank you all for your outpouring of love. This is the nicest group on Reddit that I've encountered so far. Thank you, MOD for your positive wishes. One of you here said you are a Hospice worker. God bless you. No way I have the compassion & fortitude that you folks have, to do what you do. You are everything to those you care for. 

I want to say that although this tragedy and the start of my retirement are intertwined, I am otherwise having a garden variety retirement. It’s awesome to walk around in the sunshine in the middle of the day, doing what I want. I’ll end this by passing on a learning. If/when someone this close to you is in an end of life situation, it’s going to be a bad time, no getting around that. Your choice is whether you want to pay up front or afterwards. If you choose the former then never leave their side. Just put your life on hold and stay by them. You’ll have a terrible time for sure. My son’s ordeal lasted over 2 months and so whatever the time span is for you, just stay there. The Hospice staff will set you up a place to sleep. Where this pays you back is when it’s all over and you go home, you’ll know you did everything you could do. There’s no guilt, you improved the experience of your loved one by your presence, and you will improve the quality of your own life. You'll still miss them. 

Its like river rafting the rapids, how you go in determines how you come out.

Just booked our flight to visit Mauna Kea on the big island of Hawaii.  I proposed to my wife there, and so we will return to the scene of the crime. It’s an interesting place, you are standing on the Earth but.. well you know when you look out of the window of an airliner? Well that’s pretty much what it looks like."
Rural retirement seems like a bad idea,"I'm curious about people's opinions and experiences with rural retirement. 

I've read on this forum and others about folks retirement plans. Many seem to involve moving to an idyllic rural location such as a lake house or many acres of woods. We have friends who are moving from a fairly urban location to the Upper Peninsula for retirement. For those who don't know, it's rather unpopulated and remote.

Having never lived outside a city, my opinion is that this seems like a terrible idea. I mean a lake house is great. But take healthcare, for example. Even if there is a decent clinic within 45 minutes, that's not going to help you with serious medical conditions like cancer care. And sure you can drive 2 hours to your chemo infusion but that type of travel can be really difficult for a sick person and their caregiver.

And what about social interaction? I mean there you are in the middle of your 40 acres basically alone. Sure there's the internet and you can drive to the one local cafe. But that's just not the same as having people around and other things to do nearby all the time.

What if you need specialized assistance? Like home healthcare or PT or the like? 

Honestly the more I think about it the more risky and frankly horrible this situation sounds to me. "
SOCIAL SECURITY SCREENING TOOL - collecting SS/survivor benefits overseas,"I found this tool today while research if you can collect your social security benefit or survivor benefit while living overseas. The answer is country dependent and is sometimes limited to only 6 months. But in many countries like France and England this tool says you can collect your benefits if you move there. I though someone might find this useful:

Does it matter if you retire on the first or last day of the month?,"My husband is retiring after 50 years at the same company. Pretty astounding in this day and age, right? The question is will it matter if he retires on the first or last day of the month (ex. 7/31 or 8/1). The actual 50th anniversary is in the middle of April, just didn’t know if the date matters for taxes or benefits or some other unforeseen reason."
Help - Retirement Asset Draw Down Plan,"Maybe not a good title. 

My (64M) wife (63F) retires in less than 3 months. I plan to retire in June of 2025. This will allow us to cobra my wife’s healthcare until she’s 65.

We have about 65% of our assets in taxable accounts and 35% of our assets in retirement accounts. The retirement accounts are:
6% Roth
5% Inherited IRA (inherited 2022)
6% Inherited Roth IRA (inherited 2024)
20% Traditional IRA/403b

We also have SS and pensions that will cover our normal daily expenses during the initial years of retirement (pensions not adjusted for COLA). 

Need to figure out a good drawn down strategy to convert tax deferred account dollars to Roth. Also want to limit taxes so hoping to stay just at or below the 22% marginal MFJ marginal bracket.

What is your sleeping pattern now that you are retired? Are you getting 8 hours?,"My last work day was last Friday but I have been on garden leave for 4 weeks before that so it’s been a month of not working already. I am finally fully retired. Woo hoo!

The first thing that I did was to remove all morning alarms on my phone which was great. However getting 8 hours sleep is a challenge since I still wake up early with only about 6 hours sleep and I don’t feel so rested. I tried to sleep some more after waking up but most of the time I can’t get any more sleep. I want to enjoy 8 hours sleep each day now that I am fully retired but it may not be as easy as I thought.

Pension payments while still working,"I've been told that I can begin collecting my pension at the age of 60.  I'm no longer working in that state so I've been  an inactive member for the past 4 years.

I'm still working though.  I'm in another state system, so I have to work until I'm 67 to be vested in their system.  I also set up a 403b with my new employer.

Can I take my monthly pension checks and put them immediately into my 403b and avoid paying taxes on it until I retire?  I certainly don't want to be taxed on it twice!"

Defining the language of the financial industry & setting expectations,"I watch this sub pretty closely as my husband and I are closing in on the window of time that ""retirement"" seems like a close reality as opposed to something far off in the distance.  I also work in the financial industry- and I see a lot of terms & advice that can be outright misleading at worst and at best obfuscate the discussion.  Like what a fiduciary is or isn't and what others mean when they talk about ""commission based"".  There are a lot of questions asked here and the response is ""make sure they are a fiduciary"" and you'll be fine.  Nothing further could be the truth and it's the culmination of very effective marketing campaigns. This is not to say understanding a financial professionals background, qualifications, experience and obligations aren't important- it is, but being a fiduciary isn't a magic bullet.  It's one of the many things that you can and should consider, and your choices will evolve over your financial life and into retirement.  

A Fiduciaries responsibility is to offer advice to you based on your particular situation without regard to the benefit of themselves or their organization- act in your best interest in short.  Sometimes that advice may come with an advisory fee, sometimes hourly fees or sometimes that is advice should be that you should purchase commission based products.  The ugly truth is that it can be much better for some to purchase commission based products that over time cost you less than if you wrap a fee on all of your investments.  Commission doesn't = bad, and fee based = good.  It's really a decision of what works for your circumstances in that moment.  Just because someone calls themselves a ""fiduciary"" doesn't mean that their advice is 100% free from conflict of interests.  In fact, if someone is advertising that they act as a fiduciary, they should (in my opinion) be able to offer you different solutions based on what your particular needs are. Often, CFP's  or investment advisors work in an environment where they can only offer you 1 solution- a fee based advisory account.  Professionals that can offer both advisory or commission based products are held to a fiduciary standard (advisory services) and a standard of Best Interest (commission based products).  Best Interest Standards offers many of the same requirements to act in your best interest and it has the added benefit that they must remove conflicts of interest- not just disclose them.

The point I guess is, that a financial professional who calls themselves a Fiduciary isn't a blanket protection from bad advice or that they will be actually able to provide a service that is in your best interest.  You should determine what services you need and what you are willing to pay for them and then select a financial professional who can offer you advice based on that. 

TLDR- Just because someone is a Fiduciary, that doesn't always protect you.

"Retired today at 65 to care for my spouse, reactions of my friends are puzzling","I had intended to work until 67, maybe then work part-time until 70.  My job was physically easy and intellectually enjoyable.  However...life, you know?  My spouse has Lewy Body Dementia, and while I've been able to work while caring for him because of a WFH hybrid arrangement, he finally reached the point where his needs make a full-time job and I can't do two full-time jobs at my age.  So I was able to get insurance and income set up and retire, and here I am at my new job of caregiving.  It's not the happy retirement we vaguely planned on.  I'm working on my mood, getting activities going, adjusting to my new reality.  However, I've discovered that I can only talk to my therapist about any of that.  My friends seem jealous that I'm retired and act like I'm living the life.  Nevermind that I'm caring for someone with severe physical and mental limitations who needs help with all his activities of daily living, working hard, doing very dirty work, and only having a few hours of paid help a week that allow me to attend to my own appointments and seeing other people.  They seem mad at me, and I feel even more isolated.  Do you lose your non-retired friends when you retire?   We aren't rich, we don't live in a palace, we can't travel, we have one ordinary older car; what is there to be jealous about?  Some of these people work where I did, and I would give anything to have a healthy spouse and be working in my nice, clean cubicle instead of being retired and caregiving.  I did so much work preparing for retirement these past few months, but I didn't anticipate this.  Is it a thing?"
Retirement in 2nd floor condo with outdoor stairs,"Hello all,

I am currently 54 and planning retirement. I got very lucky and bought my first home in early 2020. I got a pre-pandemic price with a pandemic interest rate (2.99%). 

It is a one bedroom condo with a loft. 880 square feet. It’s in the second(top) floor with no elevator, just stairs. 

I like the condo a lot, and am very mobile. I still do advanced yoga, etc. and climb my loft stairs multiple times a day as I have my home office up there and I work from home. 

Because I like the place and have a terrific deal, I would like to consider this my forever home. My one concern is the outside stairs. I’m not concerned about the inside stairs as I can do whatever I need to with those and everything I need to live is on the main floor anyway (laundry, bedroom, bathroom, kitchen). 

I done some research and there do seem to be options for outdoor stair assistance and my thought is that these options will probably improve over the next 20-30 years. 

Because I have no heirs or partner, the option of a reverse mortgage (the kind that lasts until death) is something I consider in a worst case scenario (forced early retirement, medical emergency etc). But I fear doing that in a place with outdoor stairs. 

Seems like my best bet is to plan a move to a CCRC around age 80 (which is when I will have e this place paid off if I don’t pay it off early—with my low rate I’ve been investing instead). 

Why I’m asking for here is any opinions on those outdoor stairs. It’s just one story. 

Open to thoughts and opinions on any of the above.

Estimating Yearly Total Medical Costs,"For those that keep track/spreadsheet expenses, are you able to share your total all-in medical/healthcare cost for a year?

I'll be retiring end of this year. Husband already is retired but on my company insurance. Neither of us are enrolled in SS or Medicare yet since there's other coverage, but intend to upon retirement. His current medical needs are much higher than mine are.

I'm not looking for detailed info or a breakdown of costs. Just a lump number. I know everyone's situation is different.

Just trying to figure out if my estimates for the future seem accurate (or close).

Thanks!"
Started to trade as soon as I retired…,"Hello fellow retirees!

I retired just recently and now have lots of time available to do what I like. I have always loved trading. Whenever  had time, I would always do great. Whenever I didn’t have much time, I would just let positions ride and lose money. Overall throughout the years I managed to bounce back. Now coming into retirement, I have ample time to take advantage of the new found freedom to do what I love.

My question is: Have you started trading as soon as you retired?

How did you get into it smoothly? 

Have you managed to maintain and grow your profits that you worked for over the past 30-40 years?

Any safe strategies that are working for you? Please share.

Thanks!

Struggling to Simply Relax Sometimes,"I'm not really asking for advice, just sharing I guess.

I am only 2.5 months into my retirement, and I am enjoying it immensely.  I never even think about my old job, even though I worked there for almost 27 years.  I honestly can't believe how quickly it evaporated from my consciousness. 
 
My weeks have flipped:  my wife still works so we do more relaxing things on the weekend, then I spend Monday to Friday staying busy with projects around the house and/or yard.  
  
My ""issue"" is that I have more desire to stay busy than my 63yo body has the stamina.  I guess I need time to adjust.  
  
For years, I was a weekend warrior.  I wore myself out on Saturday and Sunday with chores and projects, then ""rested"" during the work week (since I was sitting at a computer.)  Now I am outside almost every day doing physical stuff.  When I try to relax a little, I find myself feeling anxious because I'm not getting things done.
  
Like I said, I am still finding my new ""normal""."
Are current expenses meaningless?,"As I'm beginning to plan for retirement, I've read plenty of articles and used several calculators to determine what we'll need as the magic number to retire.

Here's the thing though, they're ALL based on current expenses.  What about looking at it from the opposite pov?  If I retire at 62, our monthly expenses will need to be reduced to x, if I wait until 65, it would be y.

I just think when it's time we NEED to control monthly expenses, there's no choice.  Today if we decide to go out to eat, we just do it.  Buy more gifts for kids and grandkids, no problem.  In retirement all those type of expenses can be controlled.  Not to mention we won't have a mortgage payment.

For example, round numbers, if I expect to receive $12k a month consisting of SS and 5% withdrawal rate on investments and determine we can live on that, does it even matter what our expenses are this year?"
Retirement Incentive for Faculty? What would you do?," I'm 62 Professor with 37+ years of R1/R2 experience. Financially, I have not needed this job for a decade. I love almost everything about it -- I love research and teaching and the social sides of it, though I don't enjoy the grading and committees.  
My Uni is offering a retirement incentive of ""up to"" 2 years' salary. There is a limited incentive budget; I make way more than average. I am also considered more productive than most, and I have an endowed position they will need to replace. Thus, it's unclear if I'll even be selected. I can either take this incentive deal (if offered) or fall back to my previous plan to do a few years where I am largely remote and teaching online when I have to teach. I'm in a good position for either. I've already wound down my lab, and most Ph.D. students (2 left) and most of my last larger grants finish Phase 2 in Nov (with an optional 3rd year where the prime does not need me but where we have a chance for more $$). I've already been preparing to retire in another 3 years (using a 50% pay full-year sabbatical 25/26). Still, the DW wants to move to the beach, so I'm considering moving up the timetable if offered the incentive, for which I've applied.  
My concern is that if I take the deal, I may lose control over the >$500K discretionary funds that I control, basically, the savings I built up over the past two decades to cover any gaps in my large contract funding. It's more than I need to cover my remaining students, and I hope to use some for “summer salary” over the next few years. If I get selected, I can try to move some of them to support the program I love. Still, it seems tricky since the ""incentive"" allows no formal negotiations, so in theory, I cannot even require that I get control of my research, let alone discretionary accounts. With the campus budget shortfalls, I can see the admin sweeping up the saved funds. If I don't take the deal, I think I can probably retain more control and pay a few years of summer salary out of those funds. In theory, the campus could sweep them anyhow as soon as they are aware of my plans and even use them for my “payout.”  
They say there are no negotiations on the incentive, but I meet the head of the campus this week, so I can try to make my case, though nothing will be in writing. But as soon as I bring up the funds, they will be very aware of them and may be more likely to sweep them. Some questions I keep asking myself? Is this incentive a good deal idea for me to consider? Do I only talk about control of my research funds and then deal with others if I get selected? Do I bring up the discretionary fund and offer to use some for the buyout to increase my chance of being selected? Do I keep quiet and try to move them to someone else in the summer/fall if I am selected for retirement?  
I thought I'd ask if anyone has experience with something like this as well as asking “the crowd” what you would do."
Wish me luck.   Giving notice of retirement ,"Wish me luck.   I’m telling my boss of my intention to retire at the end of May.   

I’m 64 and my numbers look good.  

I have a good job and have been working from home for 10 years     Work in a good field too - Info Security, but it’s time.  

I’ve been working since I was 12 and I’m tired.   Made up my mind a few weeks ago after spending time with my very ill 93 year old father in law - taught me the value of the importance of time. 

Obviously, I’ll be very professional and be a true professional.

The thought of going on a cruise or a vacation of more than about 5 days fills me with absolute dread. My husband keeps asking me what I want to do for retirement and I have no grandiose ideas. I want to see my kids. I want to hang out with grandkids if any come our way. I want to take walks. Maybe do a little gardening. I want to relax. That’s it! Am I alone in feeling this way? "
Kiplinger Retirement Report - does anyone have opinions?,"  
I've received a mailing regarding the Kiplinger Retirement Report, and I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with it.  I've found this and several other Reddits to be very useful, so I'm wondering if Kiplinger would be helpful as a supplement or if it would be a rehash of info I can find here and elsewhere online.

Fighting ageism the last few years at work.,"My co-workers are 24 to 38. My boss is 37. Her boss is early 40's. I am 60. I have five years to go.

I remember being that young and I get that they do not even know what they are doing. They simply can't see it. That makes it hard for me to be mad about it because I understand, but it is screwing up my life.

I am left out of important meetings, decisions and discussions, even if I was the one who recognized the issue that needed to be addressed. This happened today. My boss had to be in the meeting because another guy couldn't be there. I was left out even though I was the one who recognized the issue, contacted a vendor who could solve the problem, and participated in other meetings where it was discussed.

I have been compared to my team-mates grandparents, who apparently were not in the workforce, since they cannot operate a computer or a smart phone.

We have a lot of different technology, software, etc. When I say I am going to learn something, they tell me not to do so. Seriously. We had a good GIS employee who was fired. I said that I would look into learning the necessary program (it is a flow mapping software). I was told that a younger employee would do that and that I should not.

This is so hard because they just can't see it. I remember being mid 30's, early 40's. I knew EVERYTHING!

Do I just mark time and basically do nothing at work while getting a paycheck? Do I point out things to them when they leave me out? 

This sucks. I want to matter at work and they won't let me."
WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE AT 69 YEARS OLD?,"(TLDR: A 2-minute stream of consciousness about aging, friendship, and happiness).

Like a blurry-eyed man standing in front of a mirror, I lived most of my life without much introspection. Could I attribute the condition to my forty-year slog on the corporate hamster wheel? Standing in the long shadow of time, I see deep creases on my face. Clarity takes shape like the perfect aperture setting on a camera.

When I awoke, I rolled over, wanting closeness. My wife left for yoga. I was disappointed, but then I wasn't. The human body is miraculous; mine—still agile enough to play tennis—churns out curious thoughts of existential awareness. Who am I? What do I want? How long can I maintain my health before the inevitable decline?

Tolstoy said old age is the biggest surprise in a person’s life. During times when my health was teetering, pneumonia, herniated discs, or chest pain, it was as if I could feel the very essence of myself unraveling like the twine from a spool. I know that disease is an integral part of the life cycle.

Then again, I am fortunate because, so far, I've avoided life-changing illnesses like cancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes, to name a few. Sadly, I was surprised with clogged heart arteries last year, so I have a few stents. With cholesterol medication, exercise, and a healthy diet, I clawed my way back to health and fitness. 

A Harvard study on longevity reports that human connections are the key to life satisfaction. So, when I retired, I cultivated new friends by joining a book club and tennis league. Simultaneously, I tried to disassociate myself from self-interested individuals, vapid and dysfunctional. Over time, I made about three to four new friends, the kind I invite over to my house for a dinner party. 

Years of therapy taught me to embrace and understand my emotions. After all, the most important relationship you'll ever have is with yourself. Think about it: everything in life changes except your connection to consciousness. Listening closely to the silence, I try to focus on my feelings. Like an astronaut falling into space, it dawns upon me that I have no control over anything. But I control how I react to all the behaviors around me. 

Happiness is seeing my wife's big mop of curly chestnut, gray hair, and cute face on the pillow snoozing. Familiarity and routine are the mantra. I bring my wife coffee in bed, read the online news, go to the gym, and figure out what's for dinner. I find my sweet spot in creative writing, playing tennis, seeing my friends, and my latest hobby—teaching myself to make craft cocktails and Neapolitan-style pizza with fresh dough.

Six years into retirement, I've learned that aging is inevitable, but apathy is not, mainly if you focus on your "" why."" Acts of kindness and strong relationships with family and friends are my purpose. Furthermore, the laughter, high fives, and fatigue from my weekly tennis match helps me sleep soundly. I often replay the fun rallies in my dreams. In trying to expand my sphere of influence, my wife and I donate money to local and national charities.

Today might be the best time to be an older adult. We benefit from the advances in medicine and research. For instance, gerontologists break down the three time periods so that we can maximize our lives. The study outlines our vitality and ability to walk: go-go years (age 65-74), slow-go years (75-84), and no-go years (85+). Knowing this big picture motivates me to take better care of myself with an emphasis on weight-bearing exercises for the legs.

As I near my eighth decade, I've realized life is not a sprint but a slow marathon. Enjoyment and happiness in retirement are a delicate balance of work ethic (exercise and nutrition), relationships (yourself, friends, family), and hobbies (reading, volunteering, cooking, etc.). For some, religion and spirituality are key. I live with low expectations and gratitude for the little pleasures. Enjoy the ride because nobody gets out alive! There is an element of luck in longevity, so good luck to you.

invest in bond funds or build a bond ladder?,"We are turning 70 and selling commercial property. I will be investing the proceeds, starting at 60% / 40% and rebalancing to 70% / 30% as the years go by, between bonds and Vanguard ETF funds. I'm comfortable with Vanguard funds, which make up the bulk of our current portfolio, but have only invested in US T-  bills as an alternative. Vanguard promotes their bond funds, naturally, but I think we'll do better by building a  bond ladder with govt. agency bonds and AAA corporate bonds. I have an account at Schwab that will facilitate my plan. The Vanguard advisor points out the ease of using a fund and complexity of keeping track of the number of bonds we will own, I'm estimating 30 - 60, (trade off between  fewer larger vs more smaller bonds). I'd appreciate any observations and recommendations on the best way to go and how to comfortably track that many bonds. Thanks in advance."
How to access whole life cash value in retirement,"I am 66 and retired for two years. I've owned whole life policies for over 30 years and have accumulated a cash value of +400k. (I know, it was a bad investment, but here we are). Death benefit is about 800k. Looking for recommendations on how to best access the cash in retirement. If I cancel the policies, the cash is considered income for tax purposes. This would conflict with my Roth conversions prior to RMDs. If I borrow against it, interest accrues at 8%. I don't need the money now to live on so I am considering letting it ride and holding onto it for a legacy inheritance for kids and grandkids. Annual premium is 4600 and annual cash value increases are about 12k. Any advice?"
I am now within a 1 year window of retirement but still debating ,"If I should pull the trigger. I’ve been with same company for almost 35 years. I have planned to retire at 59.5 for a while now. We will be debt free, and financially be fine. But, I hate leaving anything ‘on the table’. If I stayed until 62, we would get health insurance for us both (wife is 54). We can afford the premiums. My struggle is do I leave 2.5 years before I would get coverage while we are both healthy or work another couple of years and leave with insurance. Recently a good friend of mine, same age, got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and is rapidly declining. That has been weighing on me as well and makes me want to leave sooner rather than later and start traveling like we have planned for years. 

Anyone else had similar situation and how did you finally decide?

Retirement at same time of spouse?,I’m a 54F who really wants to retire in two years. My partner and I have planned for retirement at age 59.  He said he is okay with me retiring in 2 years-but I’m concerned he will be resentful (even if he says otherwise).

Anyone give up homeownership completely? What are the pros and cons?,"Most folks on this sub appear to be homeowners. I'm curious if anyone is permanently renting in retirement, and intends to keep it that way? If so, why? Was it a financial necessity, just practical, or both? 

We're in our mid-sixties; one is retired and the other will be later this year.  We owned a home in the 90s for a dozen years, but because neither of us made a lot of money - or was particularly handy - the maintenance became overwhelming. (It was built in 1904.) 

We're in a HCOL area, with little savings - but fortunately, no debt. For income we'll have civil service pensions and social security, plus some VA benefits, that will total $8K - $9K a month. (But obviously, no mortgage to leverage in any direction.)  
  
We inherited $400K recently. Looking for opinions on what's the better thing to do with it: own a domicile again, which would likely be a condo, or invest/stash it somewhere (as yet unknown) with a reliable return and continue renting. Currently, we are paying far under market for our cottage, a great deal that will go away when the aging and absent landlord decides to sell. (We haven't heard a peep but it's a possibility.)

I can't quite figure out the math, or the pros and cons. No idea yet if we can afford to stay in this area, or will need to move in the next couple of years. We're considering all angles, from 55+ communities to who knows what. TIA!

Adding Monte Carlo to Your Spreadsheet,"Edit: WARNING spreadsheet references ahead. Avoid if you are allergic to spreadsheets or you get PTSD from your previous life working with spreadsheets. 😅

For the spreadsheet builders, here are two instructional videos on how to add Monte Carlo simulation to your spreadsheet.  The first one, professor Moy shows what & how to add [Monte Carlo simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV1Y3bHDPdk).  The second video, professor Moy shows how to add [Monte Carlo simulation with a retirement withdrawal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDDDw73IWyY&t=21s).  

Yes, there are many calculators out there that do Monte Carlo sim ([see our Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/wiki/index/)), but the fun is to build a spreadsheet on your own.  😉Best of all, you get to control the variables such as inflation rates, returns rates, and the standard of deviations for them.  You can add a table of historical market returns and run the sim.

Post-Retirement Shock: The Day After,"Last day of work was yesterday.  63M.  Couldn’t quite finish all the tasks I needed to complete - office still not fully cleared out, personnel paperwork not completely done.  Was expecting to feel relieved and excited at this point, and I know that friends are waiting to celebrate with me tonight, but I’m just not there.  Just feel an empty space and a deep sadness.  I’ve worked in a mid-level management position with social services, and it’s not like I want to continue with the constant Zoom meetings.  But I will miss the people, the position, and the sense of purpose.  I know that I will need to replace it, probably with something part-time.  I have hobbies and things I want to do, and my wife is supportive.  I also know that I am very fortunate to be able to retire.  I will probably start to snap out of this once I finish those tasks that I should have completed yesterday and turn in my keys and laptop.  But I think it will probably take me some time to fully embrace this new condition.

Need some input on what to do with my 401k.,"About a year away from retirement and trying to figure out what I should do with my 401k. My wife and I spoke with a financial advisor and he recommended that we should split it into two parts. 225k going into an annuity and 300k into an IRA. The annuity would be a lock in for ten years which would put me at 72 when I would gain the full yearly amount from the annuity or Icould take the cash value. I could take from it earlier but I would be penalized. I'm not sure if that is a good option. I guess that I'm feeling that, at 72, I might only have a few years left and won't fully realize the benefit of having contributed to my 401k for all these years. Any insights or advice?"
Do You Help Funding Private School? ,"How many of you help fund private elementary and secondary school for grand children or maybe even children?
 This is something I never thought would be a consideration, but we all know schools have changed so much. I taught in public school for 33 years and then retired in 2019 and worked at a Catholic school for two years just to see what the difference was as I had always been curious. I now sub at the most expensive private school in my area and at a couple of nearby public schools. The differences I see are too many to go into here, but the main difference is that in the public schools, kids are allowed to just sit on their phones and egregiously bad behavior is tolerated. It starts in kindergarten. Teachers understandably have given up the battle because admin does not support him. Been there done that. 
Then there is the matter of safety. Also, I noticed private schools often have something called Grandparents Day where grandparents come in and visit classes, have lunch, and just tour the school. I’m sure this is because so many of them are funding or helping out with tuition.
Never did I ever think this would be a financial consideration for me, but here I am."

Did you relocate at retirement after decades in one place? How did you fare?,"I'm thinking strongly about retiring at 65 in the fall, though not 100% sure I'm ready because I don't know what I'd do once the travel itch has been scratched. I don't have any particular hobbies outside of work except for walking, being in nature, exploring new places and taking photos. 

One issue is that we can't decide about leaving our city of 35 years once I'm done with this job. It's a beautiful place, but it's also challenging to be here for a variety of reasons. A big one: we've never been able to create a sense of community here, despite valiant tries. (Seattle is not known for being easy socially.) After decades, we badly want and need it. We don't even know how to go about finding it, unless we become part of an expat community somewhere. I'm not sure we're ready for international living.  

So I'm wondering if anyone had a similar challenge and made the leap. Especially to a smaller city or town.

Pension- lump sum or monthly distribution,"I retired in January and must decide whether to take my Company pension in a lump sum or monthly distribution.  I am female,  65 and in good health.  If I elect the lump sum I will get $187,382 and if I elect the monthly distribution I will get $1307 a month for life.  I am leaning toward the monthly distribution because i expect to live at least another 20 years and this option has more value then the lump sum however if I elect the monthly distribution and then die, the monthly distribution will die with me and if I take the lump sum, I would be able to leave any balance to my children.

Is Vanguard a good choice for a Managed Retirement Portfolio. Worth the free.,"I am 63 and have been managing my own investments in about half of my retirement portfolio for most of my life.   Frankly, I've not done so well in the last 5 years. It is still in the black but not near the S&P gains.

b. Put money in, incur a gain via your chosen stock, bond or mutual fund, then withdraw the money and only pay tax at your marginal rate and pay no capital gains tax.  Even if you do all this (pay in, capital gain, withdraw) in the same calendar year you make the contribution.

An odd question- eating in retirement ,"I’m 64 and getting very close to submit my retirement letter.

What do you do all day now that you are retired ? ,"I am retiring soon just coming up to sixty. I am a little concerned that when I retire, I will not have things to do.

We both have our own things that we will do including keep fit classes / Gym etc.  
I don’t want to be in the situation where I am watching daytime TV or going to a bar every day just for something to do depending on the weather.
 
A little background we are both reasonably fit and reasonably comfortably off.  Both of us are happy to carry out some voluntary activities maybe one day a week and have some ideas of what those could be.
 I am looking for feedback and advice from you good people on what you do to keep active and sociable?
Our family are all grown up so do not need our help with childminding. So, what do you do all day, what gives you the job satisfaction that you may have got from being employed, or the sociable side of things, how do you make new friends when you are retired.

I look at realistically we have the next 10 years to do all the things that we would like to do before we get to the stage where health or logistics slow us down.
 
What countries are on your bucket list and what should be on mine- anything considered?"
Retiring after working with spouse,My spouse and I have worked in the same office for almost 15 years. We will be retiring at the same time three years from now). Has anyone been in the situation? I know people can struggle to along with their spouse after they retire because of all the together time.......but this is almost the total opposite. I not sure what hurdle we may have.  I would love to get any pointers from retirees (or others) that have worked then retired with their spouse...or any perspective for that matter. Tips and tricks would be helpful. Thanks!
Does anyone here live in a retirement community & if so do you like it?,"My husband and I are thinking of moving to a land-lease retirement community of individual bungalows with basements. We would love a bungalow due to arthritis and other health issues. The community is in the country so is quiet but only a few minutes from town, and there is a community pool, gym, and LOTS of activities. HOA fees are high at about $1,000 a month including property tax and we are trying to decide if it is worth it. Love the idea of an active community but worry about the expense. We live in Ontario, Canada."
Moving from New York to California ,"I'm retired living on Long Island, New York. My son lives in California and I'd like to be near him. Is it best to have my furniture sent via moving company and drive there with my daughter or (as my son thinks) sell my furniture and car and fly out? Appreciate anyone's advice who've done this kind of move and what route they chose to do. Thanks

I've read all you're suggestions and appreciate the feedback. You've given me a lot to think about thank you all!!!"
Ordering grave monuments as part of pre-funeral planning. On line memorial. ,Is this sub Reddit appropriate for asking about pre-paying funeral expenses? If so has anyone had any luck with ordering grave site monuments thru on-line monument companies?  I ask because my local monument provider charges 8 to 12k for a basic marker and it takes two years to get marker finished and installed. 
Are there employers that actually don’t mind hiring someone near retirement age?,"I have 5 - 10 years until I retire (57F) and I want to find a job that is not stressful for my remaining working years. I am just so burned out with my current job. I’ve been there over 8 years and I am so, so tired of it. I love the money but I think I wouldn’t mind taking a pay cut if I find something that I enjoy and makes me happy. I wonder if there are job coaches out there that can help me too? Any suggestions?

Disclosing Retirement Date to Employer,"So I have set my retirement date!  I am turning 60 this year and plan to retire at 65.  March 15, 2030.  I choose this date as I want my kids to be fully financially independent.  My son is in grad school. Also,  I enjoy my job so I am not quite ready. Question is should I tell my employer.   We have a larger emphasis on career building and development.  Frankly I am at the point where I am done career developing   I am not looking for another big promotion. I would like to lead my team and help them grow for my last five years

Is there any value to having an HSA account while retired?,"I’m 67, and I have an active HSA account from my former employer, though there is zero balance in it because we spent it down last year and of course there are no more employer contributions. Now that I’m on Medicare, I think I can no longer make my own contributions to it. So is the HSA account worthless to me? Am I missing something?"
Life Alert options worth it for older singles?,"I (F70) now live alone after my husband’s recent death.  I got an Apple Watch because theoretically it will help when I fall, but I am considering a Life Alert type system. One of my best friends died after a sudden stroke, so I know anything is possible at any time. Can folks share their experiences or decision-making thinking on getting one of these systems (or not)? I check in daily with Snug but don’t have many daily activities with other people at the moment, so I could easily lie around for a day or so before anyone started to worry. TIA. "
Should I invest in Traditional IRA or only Taxable Brokerage Account?,"Hi - tax time coming up and I have until April 15th to decide to put a lump sum into a traditional IRA for 2023. I make too much to reap any tax benefits, but isn’t the fact that this grows tax free and in the future I could do a Roth ladder, reason enough to put money into this as opposed to a taxable brokerage account? I’m over 50 so would take advantage of catch up contributions. I currently already max out my 401k at work, so this would be another retirement vehicle I’m contributing to. Thoughts? Thanks! "
Is it normal for pensions to overestimate your benefits 4 and 6 years out?,"It's happened to me twice now!  Six years ago the so called benefits administrator estimated a monthly benefit (the only means to pay, no lump sum) to be $120 per month more than it is six years later.  This was an app 23% over estimate.

Now I find a second plan was close on the monthly, but off by $12k on a lump sum payout.  In percent this was under app. 9% miss on the estimate.  "
Does keeping a cash emergency fund still make sense after retirement?,"I've been keeping an emergency fund in a no penalty CD. Does it still make sense to have it once your income stops and withdrawing from retirement accounts starts?

If there's any emergency other than requiring immediate cash payment, I can always draw more from the retirement accounts. And I can't think of anything that needs cash right away though.

I am in the US if that matters."
55+ active communities walkable to the beach?,"Been looking at communities as my wife like the idea of a very active place such as what she see in adverts for Margaritaville (though we've not been yet, probably will visit one this year as we get closer to pulling the trigger.   However, she really wants to be able to take long walks on the beach every day, and I've yet to find a community that is that sufficiently close to the beach.   I realize there will be more $$, but that is not a major concern for us.

I normally am very good at searching/finding things, but I cannot seem to find a site or keywords for them.  
Does anyone know of places to look for such unicorns/mermaids?    Or keywords to help my searching

I can find lots of individual condos/houses walkable, but I worry about the community side being missing if it's not an actual 55+ living community.   She is quite introverted, so it takes a while to warm up to new people, so just random connections at community parks are not ideal.    Are there any non-religious, non-residential communities we might join for that if we do house/condo?

  
Updating with a tool I found useful.   [https://www.55places.com](https://www.55places.com) has a map view, so I can look around the shore and find communities that look walkable.. "
How do you manage withdrawals from your IRA in retirement?,"I've read that it's recommended to pull out 4-6% annually from one's IRA to subsidize retirement income.  Assuming 6% withdrawal per year at my current value, that nets me an additional $1000 per month. My IRA is completely invested in mutual funds, so if I want to withdraw, I'd need to sell shares monthly to realize the cash for withdrawal. Is that how it works? This is probably a dumb question, but I just don't know. 😊 Thanks for any info!"
House to Apartment:  How to manage expectations?,"  
After 40 years living in our home, we’re selling and relocating to an apartment to be closer to family. Our home is modest and small so we’re not forfeiting too much square footage. But I’m uncertain about the adjustment. 

We’re transitioning from .5 acre that provides a lot of privacy. The property requires a lot of upkeep, but landscaping is our hobby. I’m trying to manage expectations. 

The value of our house will not cover a new mortgage in its entirety - not with today’s prices. I do not want to withdraw from our savings and/or carry a mortgage either. So this is an issue between my husband and me. 

For those who transitioned to an apartment after decades of home ownership, what advice would you give?  What were some unexpected benefits, apart from  the obvious ease of maintenance. 


EDIT:

I greatly appreciate everyone taking time to respond. There were things we’ve considered, and things we haven’t. This has been helpful. It has been a little cathartic for me.

What is your singular favorite thing about being retired?,"If you had to pick one, just one favorite thing about being retired what would it be?

Spending time with grandchildren?
Not having a boss to answer to?
Sleeping in?
 The pure overall freedom?
 Feeling and being healthier? 
Traveling?
Owning your own time fully?
Having much more time to dedicate to a hobby?

Again, if you had to narrow it down to ONE thing, what would be your favorite thing about being retired? If time permits, and you care to, please share why that one thing.

Thanks. I'm on the countdown and a bit anxious so love to come here to be reminded of what's to come!"
Taking Medicare Part B well after 65 ... spouse still insuring you.,"Was hoping that someone who is retired/near-retired can help here.  Here is the situation:

Older spouse (65) is retired, not working, on Medicare Part A only and is covered under younger spouse's health insurance.

Younger spouse (60) is still working and plans to take Medicare Part A and B at age 65. 

The older spouse does not plan to nor need Medicare Part B at this time so they plan to defer taking it until younger spouse retires at age 65.

Here is the question: What do we have to do to avoid the 10% per year penalty for NOT taking Medicare Part B at age 65 for the older spouse?  I have been told that we must fill out form CMS L564 and submit ... but when? Do we just wait until the younger spouse applies for Medicare Part B at 65 and submit the form to SSA to confirm that the older spouse was covered the whole time (between age 65 and the age they applied for Part B)?  If not, please illuminate us.  Thank you ...

How one of the greatest financial wizards of the 20th century lost it all - Wiki Wednesday Part 6 - 3.2024,"If you are looking for personal finance information and enjoy entertaining visuals like when you were in the lower grades of school - there is a YouTube channel for you.

Next Level Life - [https://www.youtube.com/@NextLevelLife](https://www.youtube.com/@NextLevelLife)

A variety of subjects are covered such as budgeting, investing, some books, and more. This video - [https://youtu.be/56ISCu7ZA-c?si=apGLiliUJCOSPhL8](https://youtu.be/56ISCu7ZA-c?si=apGLiliUJCOSPhL8) is entitled “How one of the greatest financial wizards of the 20th century lost it all“. I liked the lessons there.

Thanks for stopping by  r/retirement .  These   Wednesday posts highlight an item   in our wiki located on the sidebar/ see more/ about / or community   information section of our subreddit .. or visit [https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/wiki/index/](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/wiki/index/)  .

"What retirement calculator for spending down do you use, and why?","Over on the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/wiki/index/) for this sub there are no less than 33 retirement calculators. Many are used in the FI community to figure out what their 'number' is, not so many are designed to figure out a few hard-to-model things: two that stick out to me is Social Security optimization (learned recently there are some 12 different Social Security programs to choose from, covered by some 2700 rules around them) and Roth Conversion (dependent upon assumptions on tax rates and interaction with RMDs etc).  
Currently am doing my homework, reading up on MaxiFI in particular as well as NewRetirement (both have Roth Conversion pieces), and would be interested in what you use in for your 'spend down' planning. My own situation - still working, early 60's, low six-figures in pre-tax, plenty of other assets (whether in real estate, LLC partnerships etc) and figure there are many others here facing the same thing."
Daylight savings time change is no big deal now,"I used to dread it, especially when my alarm would go off before it was light outside. Now I wake up whenever I wake up and go to bed when I’m sleepy, so it doesn’t really matter what the clock says. Nice little perk of retirement that I’d never considered before!"
Surviving on a fixed income in high COL area. ,"I'm starting retirement now with a relatively low fixed income. I have been looking at moving to the West Coast (in the U.S.) somewhere, and then blown away by the cost of living. Rents are through the roof. I'm wondering how other retirees manage on the west coast? I have a teacher's pension and I can't help but think that the teachers pensions of people who are staying out there are pretty close to the same as mine. Are there any tricks to the process? I've seen 55+ mobile home communities that seemed semi-affordable in some areas. Are there any tax breaks, other incentives that senior people qualify for on the west coast that I'm not aware of? I am going to come out of retirement if necessary to realize my dream of living on the west coast for at least the next 5 or 10 years, but if there is a trick I am all ears"
Share a memory of your travel … whether you retired or not,"Let’s change the subject a bit.  Whether you have retired or not, do you have one favorite photo that brings back a great memory of the place you have been?

My wife and I love to travel and visit national parks. We could hardly wait until I retire in five short years and continue our visits to the rest of the national parks. We are looking forward to getting the [lifetime senior pass](https://store.usgs.gov/lifetime-senior-pass)!  To date, we have been to six and our favorite so far is Yosemite!  Every time I look at this shot, it brings me back to our visit …  In a couple of weeks, the missus and I will be heading to [Bryce Canyon National Park](https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm) for the third time!  Love that place, too!

If you have a favorite photo of your all times favorite landscape shot, please share.  If you don't travel and have a great shot of your local national or state park or a place worth visiting, please share and don't forget to let us know where in case we happen to be in the vicinity.

Edit: wow ... a special thank YOU for sharing.  I enjoy looking at the photos and reading the postings!  My bucket list has grown a large number of items since this morning!"
Does climate change factor into your decision making?,"One factor retirement scenarios do not take into account is climate change and it's impact on quality of life, expenses and longevity.  

Will more frequent wildfire smoke exposure trigger pathologies sooner than normal?  Will mycotoxins from flood damage make us so ill we wish to die?  Will insurance costs increase even more..which increases cost of shelter?  Will crop failures make food even more expensive? What will the climate be like in 25 years in our chosen location?  How can enjoy frequent air travel to bucket list destinations with such a high carbon footprint? 

I was working towards a PhD in climate related field (environmental geochemistry) 30 years ago before I switched to medicine, so these are the unknowns that keep me awake.  "
Falling down at the finish line and an inheritance - looking for advice,"My hubby is 71 and a retired state worker but has worked part time for Uber and Lyft for the last six years. I’m 66 and on FMLA for PTSD from high stress healthcare job. This  last year, my hubby and his brother cared for their older brother battling cancer. He paid my hubby enough to cover our budget. My sweet BIL passed a few weeks ago, died at home with his beloved brothers…and left us an inheritance, about a $500k. We have $80k left on our house with $1250 a month payment. If I pull social security with both of us not working, we’re short by about $1000 each month. My BIL left a solid will and there are no grievances. Honest good people. But I hear this will all take 9 months to a year to settle anyway. Part of the inheritance will be selling his house. We’re grieving and tired … do we stop working and use our $32k emergency fund to cover our budget until the estate closes? Do we not take a chance and both try to work a bit until the inheritance comes in? Do we not count the chickens before they hatch or give ourselves a break. What do you think? Any stories to share? Hard for me to trust I guess. Thanks for your thoughts and support! "
Should I move or should I stay? ,"We F(62) M(64) reaching out because I've been reflecting on our experience in our
master-planned community( not a 55+)  near Wilmington, NC, and I'm starting to
wonder if it's time for a change. We've been here for over 2 years
now, and at our age, I believe that's a fair amount of time to assess
whether a community is the right fit for us.

One of the challenges we faced was buying our home during Covid,
making it difficult to gauge whether the community was thriving.
Additionally, as we bought a resale home, we noticed that other
neighborhoods, where residents moved in together, seemed to have
stronger bonds. While we're accepted in our neighborhood, we've
encountered challenges such as feeling excluded from tight-knit groups that formed prior to us moving here 
and struggling to make sincere connections.

I do volunteer work, attend church, and most people consider me to be
fun, sincere, and kind. However, being from NY, I'm used to being a
straight shooter, which hasn't been my experience down here. I'm
finding it difficult to navigate the social dynamics and form genuine
connections.

Now, I'm contemplating moving, possibly to the east coast of Florida,
but I want to ensure that we thoroughly research any potential new
community to avoid a similar situation. When we looked in 2020 Florida was too hot, traffic was horrendous and the political climate was way too toxic. Surprisingly, here we do not speak politics. Another thing to add is that in NY I was totally middle working class.  Here I was able to buy a beautiful house in a stunning neighborhood and by my measures it’s upper class. I’ve notice some really bad behavior that comes with money. Racist remarks, entitlement and the non stop High School antics are annoying.  
Yes, we’ve been invited to some events not invited to others.  If we say no to some events people want to know, what where and why. I also noticed ppl will go with the best offer and bail at the last minute. Really? So effing rude and even in HS not nice but yes, I did that. 
Today, I know that would be hurtful to the host and I just don’t do that. 
So, I'm curious to hear from others who have gone through a similar
process. How did you effectively research a community before making
the move? What factors did you consider, and what resources did you
find most helpful?

I want to make an informed decision, and any insights or advice on
researching communities would be greatly appreciated.

Retirement date changed and spouse mad,"I went for a pre consultation about retiring but the rep I spoke to didn't seem knowledgeable   I was a given a date of 6 months from now which didn't seem correct.  I went for another consultation and thankfully I did because I was given wrong information.   I work for a job that the longer I stay,  the higher my retirement is. If I left in 6 months, like the other rep said, I wouldn't have received hardly any pension.  But with this new info,  If I stay 1 1/2 more years,  my retirement $ will be so much higher and my spouse and I could live pretty well.  

Well back story: we live in NJ and when I retire,  he has always wanted to move to south Carolina. It's a hard decision because I have a daughter 30 years old and thinking of leaving her made me very upset but I've posted about it on this thread and received great advice, which I'm so thankful for and was trying to push my sadness aside and live for my spouse and I. But now with this retirement date change, he feels I'm thrilled and he's hurt. He was hoping i would be upset and feel angry that I can't retire and us move in 6-8 months.  I am happy because it does mean more time in NJ with his family and our daughter but I'm disappointed because I still have to work more time than I thought and I'm getting older.i love being home lol. 
My question is how do I reassure him that our dreams of moving will still happen just that my time at my job needs to remain for a while longer.
He is a wonderful man but he does suffer from occasional depression (which I didn't mention before because it didn't seem relevant but now with this info he's dealing with about a longer stay in NJ, I wanted to share that). He gets into his own head and falls deeper into sadness when things like this change, which is y I'm asking for advice. Thank you all"

Can I use my HSA to pay for COBRA premium?,"Can I use my HSA to pay for COBRA premium?

I am planning early retirement next year and will need a few years of insurance until Medicare kicks in.  Initially may take COBRA until I sign up for Obamacare.  I know that I can use HSA to cover my deductible but can I also use it to cover premiums?
I also want to know if COBRA would cover both, me and my wife, or just me?  Any suggestions and gotcha I need to look out for when planning for medical coverage until Medicare?  Is dental and vision also part of COBRA?  Sorry for so many questions but I am trying to figure out my expenses during retirement to make sure I am not making a mistake by taking it early."
What Percent of Net Worth is Your Home?,"We are planning to consolidate and purchase what I hope will be our last home (first floor primary and laundry) .

I have found a house that checks all the marks but I (the conservative saver in the family) is wondering whether we are putting too much of our net worth into the house. My husband thinks we are fine and can handle the maintenance and pay the property tax - with possible increases that are capped by the state, and thinks we have worked hard to be able to purchase this house or something like for the remainder of our lifetime.

It might be better to know the ratio of your home value to investments and savings. Either calculation would be helpful.

Thanks in advance!

Edit and update: Thank you all for your input on what we should be considering. "
Anyone have a late career surge before retirement ?,"Long story short - I am now experiencing a unexpected surge in my career. As I look at 7 more years till full retirement, I thought I would be kind of walking to the finish line. Nope,  I am sprinting like a 40 year old - except I am not a 40 year old.  Money increases and promotion have occurred.

it is a good company, ethical, and they treat me well. I am doing some amazing work right now. I also could really use the money I am getting to shore up up my savings and improve my home before retirement.

Mixed feelings at my age over this surge.  Then again I was always kind of  late bloomer in my life.

Post edit - thanks for all the replies and similar stories. I would explain my mixed feelings further - the money and recognition is VERY nice - never had compensation like this before.  It would have been easy peasey to have just continued what I was doing before this surge. On the other hand I will hit retirement having done one of the most significant things I have ever done in my career and extra cash in the retirement account."
Should I just payoff the house?,"Recently widowed and just retired. And yes I’ve heard every pro and con imaginable on this subject but still have not made my mind up. 
I’ve done the math and I feel I have adequate savings and medical coverage barring anything catastrophic. 
Like many of us my mortgage takes the largest chunk monthly but otherwise  I have no other expenses outside of household expenses and discretionary. 
I go back and forth on whether the tax write off is enough impetus not to bite the bullet and get rid of this monster. 

I now live on a fixed income (SSA and pensions) so  I am fortunate and if it makes financial sense to carry my mortgage I will but I would love to hear other perspectives. Thank you"
Surprise Retirement-Trying to Make the Best of It,"A few weeks ago my husband (60) received an early morning phone call from his manager and the HR representative, letting him know that he is retired effective immediately.  He had planned to work another 3-4 years, but apparently the company has initiated a wave of salary reductions due to deteriorating market conditions —so here we are.

We are doing our best to accept that while this wasn’t in our timing, retirement was always the goal during his almost 35 years with the company.  To be honest, we hadn’t even gotten around to talking about what our life would look like once he’s retired. My question is about the more mundane logistics about being retired….how did you and your spouse redistribute household tasks, how did you find a new routine? Any hints for addressing this aspect of retirement?"
Who was the first person you told once you made the final decision to retire?,"Aside from your spouse or partner, if applicable, who is the first person you told once you made the final decision to retire? Why that person?

I have friends who have retired and my guess is that I will call one of them first. They of course 'get it' and will be very excited for me.

My kids will be up on the list as well. They are all pretty tied up in their own lives right now but two of them will want to celebrate with and for me.

One of my siblings called me first when they decided to retire. They were scared to death! I hope I was able to give them the encouragement and excitement they needed and deserved, and they did go through with it!

So, who did you call first?

Calling all those single retirees....need your input!,"Lots of great information in this forum, thank you.

I hear a lot regarding couples and their travels, their relationships, their finances. But the one thing I don't see a lot of is singles. How planning for retirement might be different for single folks. Retirement transition for singles. Ways to keep involved when you are single (and down in the dumps).

So, all those folks ***who were single when they retired,*** any single specific advice to give?

Has anyone set up a Pet Trust or Similar,"I'm single, retired and all my friends have relocated to warmer climes.  Luckily, I have 3 cats to keep me company, and I'd like to make sure they don't end up in shelters if (god forbid) something happens to me.  .  This is becoming a problem, because it's keeping me from doing things like traveling.  Monies not an issue, but I'm not up for dumping my pets on my friends because their enjoying their retirement childless and mostly petless.   You can set up pet trusts, but you have to have trustee to pay out the money to.  There's no way to leave a restricted bequest to a person for an animal.

Thank you for all the replies.  Yes you can set up a trust.  You can set up a trust for anything lawful.  That's not the problem, the problem is the execution of your wishes. I've monitored enough non-profit trusts to see the reality of a decedents wishes not being honored. 

 Rather than being adopted out again, I'd prefer that they live out their days in a staffed facility that houses cats.  My feeling is that there's sufficient childless old-cat lady money out there to endow these places if they were established.  "
Ego destruction in retirement? ,"I'm looking at retiring. I've been very fortunate and I don't forsee any financial problems. 

However, ever since I was a child, I have measured my worth by my production. This was ingrained in me by my father and despite years of therapy, this issue remains. 

I'm exhausted and sick of having to prove this to myself over and over. For this reason, retirement terrifies me

Anyone else wrestle with this? "
When to give notice? Because I’ve had enough!,"Hello. I am 7 weeks away from what I plan to be my last day at my very corporate and very stressful job. My manager is not the easiest to work for and I feel like I’d feel way less stressed w the constant barrage of last minute priorities and her tone once I give notice. 

What would you think are the advantages or disadvantages of this type of early announcement? I am sure they would appreciate it as my role is complicated, and I can certainly demonstrate good faith in my message. But I want to ensure no risks exist. 

Why do I feel bad about telling them? 

My understanding is if I provide a last day date, they are obligated to pay me and insure me until that date. 

I will really enjoy snarking back at her once this announcement is over lol. 

Thank you!"

"""What I know now"" retirement advice?","I'm nearing retirement age. Over at AskOldPeopleAdvice, I appreciate the posts where people share their wisdom concerning things they would have done in hindsight. Because I work in healthcare, I know about the regrets people have about their lifestyle choices, esp about health, money, and relationships. I have lots of concerns about retirement since my parents didn't plan well for it, so I have no role models around how to do that properly.

Who else has developed minor bad habits after retirement?,"I retired a little over 3 years ago. I find that one aspect of my grooming has really taken a nose-dive. I shower,  brush/floss as much as always, but I have gotten _really_ lazy about shaving (I’m a guy, so facial shaving.) Thing is, I dislike facial hair. So it’s a cycle of “I can skip shaving today!” Then I ignore it for a week or so, then I finally _have_ to shave, and it’s a pain to do as there’s so much hair. But I never learn! I’ve repeated this cycle close to 100 times now. 😄 even at this moment I think “I should just go shave right now since it’s on my mind!” but inertia is having me reply “naaaw… you can put it off!”

Signing up for Medicare online,"I'm 64 and recently decided that I'm going to work until I'm 67. But I have to sign up for Medicare at 65. Since I will still probably carry my insurance through work, how do I go about signing up for Medicare? Can I just go on to Medicare website and sign up to get Part A? I believe that is all I need and have to get at 65 to avoid any penalties in the future.

Little-known retirement planning tool,"I see a lot of people here asking if they can retire, or saying they've asked their advisors if they can retire.  It seems to me that they might be missing a valuable retirement planning tool: a budget.  Having a budget for my entire working life really helped me know if my retirement savings and Social Security would support me.

Knowing how much you have is only half the equation, you have to know how much you need.  People seem to know the first number, but often not the second."
What made you decide to retire? How did you know you were ready?,"What made you decide to retire, and how did you know when you were ready?

I’m 57, i’ve been in the same profession for 35 years and will have a decent pension. I need to decide whether or not I retire in a few months, or if I decide to renew for another one-year contract. I’m free to retire anytime, but if I commit, I commit.

Too much of my identity is related to my job, and it does give me a sense of purpose and fulfillment. I may decide to put another year in, but I would not put in any more. I just don’t feel like I’m ready to hang my hat just yet. Then again, I lost both of my parents in the past year and I’m reflecting on the future and how many good years I have left to enjoy life. Once I retire, I’ll need to find some hobbies and a new path forward, but I am pretty good at adapting so the loss of purpose will just be something to work through and enjoy the new phase of my life.

A friend of mine told me that you get up one morning and you just know when it’s time to retire. That’s what happened with him. I’m just not there yet, but I know I’m getting there. Just curious to know… what was your tipping point?

Retiring and considering moving,"Hi everyone. I need advice or just really just to talk.  I live in New Jersey and my spouse has always wanted to move to South Carolina since I met him. We've been together for many years. We have 1 daughter who is almost 30, great job, lives in her own and knows that moving to the Carolinas is something her dad always wanted when I retire. He has his own plumbing business but he can do that anywhere. I have a city job and will be retiring in about 1 year.  I always promised him that we'd move when I retire. Honestly taxes in New Jersey are so high that when I do retire, we can't afford to stay in NJ.  The taxes in the south are so much less that we would have a great easy life plus the weather is amazing. Anyway now that is becoming reality, I'm having such a difficult time imagining leaving our daughter. We spoke about it and she is totally ok with it. She loves to travel and she don't know is she'll always live where she is anyway.   Which is now about 40 min away. She knows her dad has always wanted to be in a warm state so she thinks that me now deciding I don't want to is not fair to him.  She honestly told me that I need to live for me and not for her.  With all that being said,  why do I feel horrible about thinking of leaving her? I wish she'd meet someone nice and decide to have kids so than I know my spouse will stay in NJ but that's such a selfish thing for me to ever say.  Has anyone been in my situation and I will take any advice.  I mean, as I'm writing this,  it honestly feels like a great decision because my daughter is the most important part of my life and she's totally ok with all this. But I feel like I'm abandoning her and I'm devastated. 
Thank you. "
What Surprised You About Life in Retirement?,"OK, I'm less than a month now from my last day of work.  I'll admit that I'm a little nervous about the journey ahead.  I'm not as concerned about the financial part of it as much as the adjustment to not working and just the whole life change.  For those of you who have been retired for a while now, what surprised you most about what you thought retirement would be like and how it actually is for you?"
Opinions on Pool Ownership in Retirement,"We are consolidating our properties with plans to buy or build our last home. We are in our early sixties.

One of the features we are considering is whether or not we want a salt water pool. We live in FL, love the water, and have children in their twenties. 

I would appreciate hearing from those of you who love or loathe your pools, why, and any suggestions you might have one way or the other. "
How long before it all clicked?,"My wife and I are approaching our one-year retirement anniversary, and it's been everything we had thought it would be. ""Every day is Saturday,"" etc. Waking up whenever and simply going with the flow of the day. Our work was our life and our social life was with work colleagues. 

After we retired, we moved in September, bought a home and left our old town and social life behind. It was an adjustment, and our daily life became very quiet, very quick. It is just my wife and I and no pets. The adrenaline rush of a daily work schedule evaporated overnight. We do take our daily walks together which is very enjoyable. 

So essentially, we spent fall and winter in our new home waiting for spring to arrive to start enjoying the better weather. My wife is starting to go crazy from being cooped up. I, on the other hand, am totally happy doing nothing. Literally, I can easily sit in my chair, read, go in the office and fiddle on the computer and I'm good. My wife does not have any hobbies, and both of us have not developed any new social structures yet. We plan to, though. Travel is on our plate, as well as possibly volunteering to keep us in a social mix. 

I mean, it's only our first year, so I assume things will iron out and we will find our groove. I'm 63 and my wife is 65 so I know these are the ""go-go"" years and we are healthy so we can't complain about anything. We know we are very lucky. 

One thing that does keep us both sane - being that we are spending 24-7 together - is that we are indeed best friends, so we do enjoy each other's company. 

**Question is, how long did it take for you to find your sweet spot and get comfortable with your new normal? Year? Two years? Longer?** Yikes!"
I am retiring from teaching with hundreds of ties,"Retiring and so, so many ties!

I will retire in June from 30 years of teaching. Over the years I have had a lot of fun collecting ties to wear to class. I have the typical boring ties (not many), funny, cartoon, sport-themed, holiday and crazy ties. I have close to 200 ties and I hate to get rid of them. I am giving some away but I am searching for ideas to integrate them into my new life as a retired person who would like to remember back to my tie-wearing days, because I don’t see too many of those days in my future of building a man/sports cave, brewing beer or watching Tennessee Vols. Any ideas would be awesome. Thanks."
I'm having trouble finishing books.,"They say most books should be an article and most articles should be a tweet. Maybe that is why I'm having a heck of a time getting through books these days.  
  
I can get through a third to half of nonfiction books and even less of fiction. After that I simply lose interest. I didn't used to be this way. I don't think it is my choice of books; I'm reading similar ones to the ones I used to easily finish.  
  
Maybe the internet has destroyed my attention span.

That Sad Sunday Night Feeling...,"I've spent my whole career life in 9-5 middle and upper management office jobs with high stress. I recently took an early retirement after the company was gutted in a layoff. And while it was absolutely the right thing to do, every evening I get the sad feeling like it's Sunday night and there's another tough day ahead of me tomorrow. Did anyone else get this feeling and does it fade away after a while?"
With what age group(s) do you most want to associate in retirement?,"Aside from family, would you rather be in community with a 55+ group or with a more diverse group of ages? The 55+ group might have more in common with you and use less confusing language. The more diverse group might keep it more interesting, though you may have less patience with different generations.

I personally strongly favor the more diverse group of ages, including little kids, teenagers, college/young singles, parents of young kids, parents of teenagers, empty nests but still working, people my age, people in their 80's and 90's. I'd much rather live in a city to support that choice than to live in a retirement community. But that's me."
Too much daydreaming about retirement,"I'm turning 60 and had my review with Fidelity and things are more or less on track. My target is to be able to retire at 65 but evaluate finances, my mood at work, if there are any opportunities coming to get laid off and get a severance package, etc so who knows, maybe I'll work until 67. My issue is, since my review with Fidelity, I find myself thinking about it way too often.  I'm close but not that close. I'm thinking about doing my spring yard cleanup and my thoughts go to ""hmmm, in 5 years I'll have plenty of time to get this done"".  I think about finances, what I'll do, babysitting my grand kids, taking walks, projects, being able to grab a beer at lunch, and generally what my day will be like.  Maybe I'm just burned out and struggling with the final stretch. It's making time go by slower because I'm watching the clock. Anyone else deal with this?  Is it normal?  Did it go away after it's onset?  "
What is your relationship with your family and friends if you've moved away?,"My wife and I are looking ahead towards retirement in a few years. We're considering staying where we currently live in NY because almost all of our family and friends are here. We're also considering a move from our HCOL area to a LCOL area, probably somewhere in NC/SC where our retirement dollars would go a lot farther. My question is for anyone that moved far away from their family and friends. How did that turn out? Was it difficult? How often do you see your kids/grand kids/siblings/friends? Would you do anything differently? "
Where's a good place to snowbird?,"My wife and I are just about ready to retire up in Wisconsin.

What are you paying for Medicare B + G/N per person ?,"We have at least 5 years before full retirement and we are starting to do some long range budgeting.

For Medicare, given our health issues we have now we want as much coverage as possible which I think means A+B+G (or N) coverage.

What would be a good rough budget for us to plan on paying for this in today's dollars?  I am thinking it would be $500-600 per month for the both of us ? Our estimated yearly retirement income would be Pension+SS+IRA = $150,000 per year joint file."
Just completed my first week of retirement - I want to keep my brain healthy!,"I am enjoying being retired so far.  Haven't really done much except for a little more reading.

He is physically healthy, but seems to have lost a lot of his common sense, reasoning ability and problem solving.  He doesn't have dementia or anything, just not as sharp as he used to be.  I have always been the ""brains"" in our household and have thought of myself as a smart, sharp, intelligent person.  I am terrified of losing that sharpness.

"Been there, done that. What else is there?","We're 10 years retired, in adequate health but not up to hikes, and tired of the culture.

Has anybody considered moving to the Midwest?,"I'm retired and my wife is being forced out of her job this year. We live on the west coast (USA), Washington State, not California. I'm originally from Michigan and she is from Asia. Financially, I think we'll be fine if we stayed here, but taxes have been increasing. Our house is paid off, and it has more than doubled in the time we have lived here. It's not like a million dollar house, but we did okay.

I was looking at condos in the Canton Twp., Novi, Northville area between metro Detroit and Ann Arbor, and I'm just really surprised at what a person can get for between $225 - $300k. And just for fun, I was looking in some areas that have small colleges, like Muncie, IN and Albion, MI, and a person can get what appears to be a pretty decent ranch style (mid-century modern) house for under $200k. And these are just random places. I'm sure there's quite a range all over.

I had even read that many people between the ages of 60 - 69 were moving the places like Cleveland, Buffalo and Ft. Wayne. SO, my questions is have any of you made that move, where did you go, how much did it cost; or are you considering such a move.

Nomad in retirement question / advice,"I’m 68, single and have a healthy retirement portfolio with no debt and live in an apartment.  I plan to quit working in December.  I have one daughter, son-in-law and grandson in Colorado, another daughter, son-in-law and grandson in Canada and a third unmarried daughter in Texas.  When my lease expires in September, I’m thinking of doing “Furnished Finders” and just doing a round robin between each daughter’s city.  I’d probably want to drive my car to each city so I’ll have transportation and then spend 3 - 4 months in each location with a possible vacation to another place from time to time.  I’m in the process of shedding everything big that I have and will shrink it down to clothes, computer, a few personal things and my favorite pillow and towels. Everything needs to fit comfortably in my 4 door sedan or it’s not coming with me. 

Has anyone else done this and have tips, advice or experiences to share?

Thanks!"
Assisted living is very expensive - so let the government take care of it?,Assisted living and nursing homes can be very expensive. I know in my area assisted living in a nicer facility starts at $80K a year. I also know that once a resident exhausts their assets the government takes over - and in many cases the resident can stay in the facility they're in. So to be perfectly blunt...why shouldn't I just move all my assets out of my name and if the time comes that my wife or I need assisted living I would just let the government would pay for it? Wouldn't we all prefer to leave our hard earned wealth to our children instead of exhausting it to pay for ridiculous healthcare costs? I'm new to the retirement discussion so I'm guessing moving your assets is already a thing?

Need to determine how to allocate my nest egg to get both growth and Income. ,"I am retiring at the end of April. Woohoo! 
Wife already retired. I have three buckets of income upon which one of the (my IRA) I am asking for ideas/advice on asset allocation. 

Some background:

Both wife and I will turn 65 in May.

Income bucket 1:
Plan to take social security in May. Both of ours will come to $4900. Minus our $900 for both medicare payments (main plus G and prescription) nets approx $4000 a month.

Income Bucket 2:
$3000 rental income offset by $900 mortgage payment. (Paid off on 5 years)
So $2100 net and then $3000 net in 5 years.

Income bucket 3:
1.4 million IRA

Currently 1 million in Fidelity Spaxx Money market earning 4.2% the rest in tech stocks and doing quite well. So I’m getting growth from the stocks and reinvesting approx $4000 a month from Spaxx. I realize I’ve been lucky with the growth stocks and the high interest rate environment. Both won’t last.

I realize that the 4+ % days of Money Markets and CD’s will soon be over.
My financial guy who I haven’t given any money to yet and probably won’t wants to put me in corporate bonds (not bond funds) and maybe even a MYGA multi year guaranteed annuity, do get my 6% long term.

(We’ll need approx $2500 out of this account  each month for income.)

In  8 weeks my paycheck goes away and I need to come up with a plan. 

What are people with 1 million ish in IRA doing for income but still wanting some growth for their portfolio. Is it possible to get reasonable growth and income while minimizing risk?

Not worried about our spending for this thread. Just looking on how to allocate the nest egg for optimum safe returns, (growth and income)

Open to all opinions and advice."

Buy a short-term rental in retirement?,"Hi, unfortunately I have RMDs coming up and it will boost my retirement income, increase taxes as well as trigger IRMAA. Any recommendations on how to reduce taxable income during retirement? 

POTENTIAL STRATEGY: I'm thinking about buying a short-term rental and taking advantage of the short-term rental loophole and bonus depreciation (after a cost segregation) this year by renting it out for less than 7 days this year. I believe that this will allow me to claim active rental income and deduct the depreciation directly against my income.

Estimated monthly expenses - how do you begin that is not too overwhelming,"I see the value of working through tools like new retirement or projection lab but at the core, the are meaningless to me if the data i enter isn't accurate and my biggest weakness is my estimated monthly expenses.  I feel pretty strong putting in different return scenarios for my investments.  Can someone please help/offer advice on expenses.  I'm 5 years from retirement and really struggling.  I've go years of credit card data but looking for the most simple, yet effective approach.  Example:  I don't need to break out the difference between buying a coffee vs eating lunch out.  I'm fine with categories like All Grocery and All Dining Out.  I've seen these spreadsheets that look almost overwhelming but maybe i just need to suck it up and do it.  I don't want to spend hours each month categorizing every expense.  Am i missing so something here or overthinking this?

For example, i can reliably forecast:  Food (grocery & eating out), basic car expenses (gas, minor repairs), Healthcare (prescriptions, copays, etc..) Entertainment. House maintenance (yard work, pool, etc..)  Health insurance, Taxes

From there, I have staggered/riskier expenses:  Major car expenses (large repair/buy new car),  Major house expenses (new roof, new AC), Major dental or health expense 

Is there a spreadsheet someone can recommend that is not too overwhelming or any advice on how to approach this?  "
Don't know where to retire. Got to social support. No partner or Kids. Advice?,"I am 63. 

I just learned the term ""Elder Orphan"". I'm 63. Seems like I'm headed to be one. Yes is scares me. :-(  

Got to face that I suppose.   

So.  What to do?  Where to go?   What town?  What living situation do I need to set up?  

I just learned the term ""Elder Orphan"" but have realized the coming situation for a while.  Avoided thinking about it too much, but did think about it.  I kept coming up with nothing.  Still come up with nothing.

My past might be relevant.

 My significant other passed suddenly in 2017.  No kids. My siblings are all much older than me.  Only one niece really keeps up with me.  She is only 10 years younger. She's in Texas.  Nothing wrong with Texas, just wasn't ever where I wanted to retire.  Got older cousins in Florida. They have kids but I wouldn't expect them to be a ""support group"". 

I am an Aerospace Engineer.  My career, by no choice of my own has have me move a lot from city to city.  I'm from the North East.  I've lived in San Diego, CA; Huntington Beach, CA, Connecticut; Everett, WA; Atlanta, GA, Savannah, GA; Melbourne, Fl.  Never bought a home with all this moving and the high costs in California.  The north east is expensive and cold.  So Cal is unaffordable.  I never bought a home with all my moving around and it seemed out of reach to me in California.

I've saved over $750K in retirement accounts.  It's the social aspect of retirement that scares me the most, quite frankly. 

Don't know what to expect from this post.  Ideas maybe?"

When to tell your boss you're retiring.,"I’m going to be 65 in September and I'm planning on retiring at the end of the month. Is there a typical time frame for letting your employers know that you are going to retire? The company's been good to me and I like the people I work with, so I’m not looking to just leave them hanging without someone to backfill my spot. I do have someone lined up for my replacement, although so far it’s just me talking to him and I haven’t said anything to my employers. I'm thinking six months should be enough. How much notice did you give when you retired?

&#x200B;

Edit for update:    Thanks everyone who's replied so far, this has been very helpful.  I think I'll take the average of everyone's answer and go with three months.  

A bit about myself and my job.  I work for a smallish size private company, about 200 employees.  It's a tier 1 manufacturing plant for automotive parts with a small (8 people) engineering department of which I'm one.  I'm the only CAD designer, been with them just over six years.  

The guy that I hope will replace me works at my previous employer, doing the same thing as I do.  I work with all three of the major OEM's plus a handful of smaller ones.  While the design work is typical of most CAD work, working with the OEM's can be a bit daunting.  They've each got their own set of design rules, plus procedures for submitting and releasing parts for production. My (hopefully) replacement is probably 80% there already, there's just some of the customers he hasn't worked with yet.  I keep notes of everything I do in OneNote, so I can just turn that over to him when I leave.

Thanks for the tip about working the first week into the next month, hadn't thought of that.  I've already started to separate my work/personal stuff. I use my personal phone for work, I get a subsidy for it, but hardly anyone ever calls me anyways.  When I first started, the guy before me moved out of the country, so there was no help from him, and the engineers didn't really know a lot about getting the permissions for data transfer between myself the the customers database. It probably took about four months to get really comfortable with all of the processes.  I don't want to do that to the next guy, my OneNotes will help a lot with that, and I will probably make myself available a few times for help.  I've also thought about maybe contracting in for the occasional times they do get really busy, all of the customers gateways seem to line up about three times a year and I get swamped.  I'll talk to HR in the next couple of months to see what they want, and honestly, if they decide to let me go early, I'm OK with that. I've been ready to go for the last year, but my plan has always been to wait till 65.

Thanks again everyone for the discussion.

Housing/Mortgage strategy feedback,"Hi,
I plan to retire in 1-4 years but more than likely towards the higher end with my Son just starting college. His expenses are covered in a 529 but ya never know…and I like (on most days) my work. We’ve a centennial in 4 years and my employer is begging me to stay on and just gave me an insane raise so it’s best to stay a bit.
Anyway, here’s the deal. We want to move for a number of reasons (closer to work, downsizing, money net, etc) but my question is a financial/strategic one.
If we sell our house, we would net about $200-230K; we owe $270K. My thought is to to buy some acreage and build our last house. We can rent during the build or buy a prebuilt container home and live in that during build. In case 2, we could build smaller and use the container for visiting friends/family.
My wife is digging option #2 fwiw ;)
I’ve built a home before and was basically the GC with a friend of mine’s guidance so understand what I’m getting myself into. We would end up with about the same amount of debt/expense and in either case, would be debt-free when my wife retires in 9-10 years.

Our end desire is to have some space, be closer to current work even though we’ve got retirement on the horizon, and downsize. Our current home is way larger than needed.

What would you do? Certainly open to other suggestions! Sorry for the wall of text ;)"
Decision to pull the plug to retire,"I  am curious to learn from those who retired. I am almost there or even there from a financial perspective. But I am finding myself delaying citing the following reasons

1. I don't hate my job- it is tolerable and I get to do some interesting creative work. On the other hand I don't jump out of my bed all excited to go to work either. There are of course office politics, having to deal with bureaucracy and unreasonable people.
2. I got diagnosed with some health issues - worry about sustainability and affordability of health care insurance.
3. Vesting of RSU's. I have a vesting plan that vests over the next three years, it feels like leaving money on the table.

How did you finally make up your mind ?"
Am I missing something financially?,"I would like to retire next year. I raised my children in a high cost of living area, and I never made a huge amount of money. I do have a pension. I spoke with a financial advisor through my employer and between my pension and Social Security. I should be able to comfortably retire. However, I still have a mortgage. I live simply. No ambitions to travel. Basically a homebody who might volunteer. I looked at the numbers myself, and agree with what the financial advisor said, however, I’ve seen things here and other places from people with many more resources than I have who are worried. Is there a hidden gotcha? I have  allowed $500 for Medicare supplements in my budget.Thank  you for any insight that you may have."
Budget broken out by percentage/ retirement calculator with pension,"Hi, my husband is retiring in 3 years at age 61.  We have the funds we need, we have a lifelong pension with joint survivor benefits, and we don't carry any debt (homes and cars are paid for and children's education is funded).  That said, my family has insane longevity and I have anxiety around money so I really like to get into the nitty gritty so I feel comfortable knowing what the next 40 years will look like. 

I'm looking for two resources as I do our budget planning. 

\- A retirement calculator that includes pension without a maximum or with a high maximum.  I have found a few online calculators but the good/bad news is his pension is substantially more than they'll let you input.

\- a budget worksheet or resource that gives suggested \*percentages\* for spending in retirement.  Like spend xx% of your monthly income on travel, etc.  Ideally one that provides give for plenty of fun since I know we have our needs met.

Yes, we have financial planners etc but they tend to look at the big macro viewand investment strategies. I'm an ""in the weeds"" kind of person who likes to crunch the numbers myself so I feel more comfortable.

What’s your asset allocation in retirement?,"I read recently several investors claiming their portfolio returns are north of 15% and I’m wondering how they’re accomplishing that.  I’m guessing they’re not retired yet so they’re not living off their investments like I am.  My returns have only been 7% as my asset allocation is 70/30.  I’m thinking I should be a little more aggressive but scared to do so?  I’m only 60 and my wife is 58.  Her family are like vampires so they live to a ripe old age which means our money has to last about 35 years.

If you’re retired, what’s your asset allocation and your returns?"
Which 'To Do' Project Before Retiring?,"Just looking for opinions from this wise Reddit group. Prior to retiring, of the three things listed below, which would you say we definitely should get done?


Upgrade VERY dated kitchen

Buy a new car (others are hitting 10 year 100k mark, but we don't drive much and generally keep cars to 200k)

OR

Get new windows (original 1960s windows still on house!)

Option chosen will be done with cash we have on hand. Which is most important to do before retiring?

I'm a healthy 63 want to retire at 65 but have this impending sense of Doom.  Like I will die before I get to retirement. 

Financially I'm OK so I'm not worried about that but I'm constantly anxious now as I'm getting closer to 65.  The  feeling of dying before I cross the finish line is sometimes overwhelming.  I honestly  do not have any mental or physical  issues.  I'm pretty chill and logical.

Anybody else felt or feel this way ?  Anybody ever hear of this ?"
Cross country move. Best way to do it. ,"I was hoping to get some advice from folks who have done this.  My wife and I currently live in Seattle.  We have lived here 30 years but it getting too expensive.  At 62 I still have a mortgage to pay on my house.  My family and kids are all on the east coast in Massachusetts and I want to be closer to them. Seattle is also way to big a city for me. M y plan is to sell our house when I turn 65 and buy a house in Maine for cash. This will allow me to have no house payment and much lower property taxes (currently paying $920 a month.).  I will have my pension and social security for income.  About $5,600 a month and savings.

My question is how does someone do this kind of move?  Do we look for a house first, buy it then sell ours or do we sell our house then move and rent?  How do you find the right town to move to without spending a lot of time there?  Also winter and summer can be different in many towns.  

Any advice would be appreciated.

Withdrawing from 401K on Social Security When Does Income Tax Start?,"I retired at 60 and have been living on savings for a couple of years. Late last year I reached 62 and started receiving my SS benefits. So I'm not worried about paying taxes on my annual income for 2023. But for 2024 I will be getting a full year's worth of SS income and I'm curious if I file with the standard deduction is there any room to withdraw from my 401k without having to pay lots of tax?  


Lets say I get $2k a month/$24K a year in SS with the standard deduction is that enough income to have to pay tax? Where is the threshold? So if I say withdraw $500 a month/$6K a year would that push me over the line so to speak? Sorry if I'm not clear but I don't really know how to say this clearly, hope you guys understand what I'm asking."
Retirement planning and grandkids,"Doing some retirement planning and wanted to get people's thoughts on retirement relocation and grandkids.

Background: Working in a large city, thinking of locating to a smaller city about 3 hours away - a regular house in the city is about the same price as a house on the ocean in the smaller city.

We have 2 kids who live in the city, no grandkids on the scene yet. But thinking about the things you consider when planning retirement, I feel like if we move then we are trading incidental contact with grandkids for an ocean view. Which feels wrong.

That said, the kids may move away anyway (like I did), its hard to start a family here with real estate prices as they are. There may not even be grandkids.

For those that have been through it how did this all work out - did you regret moving away? Did you regret staying? Did you maintain the large family home and it never really was used? Did you stay close to grandkids but never really see them regularly (like every week)? Are you satisfied seeing them on vacations, Xmas, birthdays only? Or is incidental contact something you value a lot? - i.e. coming by for lunch, grandkids being dropped off when mom and dad are in a bind or need a break.)

"Where to find financial planner for consultation (63, retiring soon, w/o a lot)","Hi folks, 63 years old (turning 64 in July), single and just got reorganized out of my job. TBH I'm tired of working, so in spite of not having a lot of assets, I'm seriously considering retiring--though financially speaking it's earlier than I'd hoped for. **I'm wondering what the best way is to find a reasonably priced financial planner willing to work with someone of limited means,** for a one or two-time consultation to 1) provide a reality-check, and 2) help with implementing the logistics of the transition to retiring if it turns out it is in fact feasible.

I've seen a couple of sites that seem designed to match folks with financial advisors/planner but I don't really know which are safe and reputable. Also I always get the feeling the services are more intended for those who've got a fair amount of wealth already or are youngish and looking for someone to help manage investments to grow into wealth. Me, I've just been muddling through without much of a plan (resulting in a 401k lower than most would consider ideal; just barely 6 months savings in CDs and HYSA, no home equity (I rent)) and now need to figure out how to make what I do have, somehow work. And if I learn enough that it seems like it won't somehow work, at least I'll know that, and will then have to face the hell of searching for a job. (I'm so grateful that a generous severance package means I at least don't need to start using up my savings right this minute).

Would love to hear about the experiences of others who've chosen to or were forced to retire under challenging circumstances."
Best part-time job in retirement?,"I (61f) haven't worked in over a year.  I worked in human services my whole career, and when they closed my program in November 2022, I didn't seek a new job.  Now my wife (64f) is retiring in June, and I prefer that neither of us take social security yet.  I'd like to get a job with my biggest criteria being that I can work when I want, something on an as-needed basis.  I've applied to Target and Walmart but they want at least a part-time commitment.  Pay and benefits are not important though I'd it to pay something, not be a volunteer position.  I also don't want to substitute teach, although I know schools are usually hiring.  It can be at least a bit physically demanding, though I am 61 and no kind of athlete.  Anyone found anything wonderful?

&#x200B;

Update:  Thanks for all the replies and ideas!  To clarify, by ""as-needed"" I mean without a set schedule, but I'd be very willing to schedule in advance and be reliable about showing up.  Just would like to go week-by-week or two weeks at a time, or be called when they need me.  

I basically took care of people - lifting, bathroom assistance, meds, feeding, and providing fun and educational activities.  I did the required paperwork involved, which was lengthy.  Then I managed a staff of about 30 who were supposed to do the same.  I can do still all that except for the heavy lifting.  "
Did your energy level go up when you retired?,"I am a little over three years away from retirement.  I feel like I don't have much energy left after a day of work.  My job is not physically demanding, but it is stressful.  I feel like it is too close to retirement for me to get a different job.  Some days, I feel like the old character who always says ""I'm getting too old for this.""

Did anyone else go through something similar and have their energy levels recover a bit after they retired?

I guess I am looking for something to give me some optimism.  "

Retiring at 59 1/2 - will I be financially ready,"I am currently 56 years old with a 54-year-old wife.  We live in Kansas so cost of living is reasonable.  We have no debt.  Current gross income is approx. $200,000/yr.

Projected assets at retirement (59 1/2):

* Pre-tax 401K - $1,500,000
* Roth IRAs - $500,000
* Pension lump sum at retirement - $583,000 (plan to roll to IRA)
* Cash - $100,000
* Social Security (combined) at 65 - $54,000/year
* House value = $450,000 - $500,000 (we may downsize at some point).  House is in great shape and should not need any major repairs for 15+ years; newer roof, new siding, newer HVAC)

Our plan from retirement to 65 is to use a combination of Roth IRA and pre-tax 401k to keep MAGI low enough for high subsidies on ACA. Estimated MAGI would be $61,000.

At 65 the plan is to pull a mix of funds from my 401k, pension IRA and SS to fund expenses.  All excess funds would be used to max out Roth IRAs each year.  

Annual expenses are estimated at $48,000/year not including fed/state tax or ACA premiums and out-of-pocket costs.  

I have run the numbers many ways and I feel I can comfortably retire but my wife is nervous.  

Does anyone see any issues or have any advice?  

I was considering doing an in-service Roth conversion of $175,000 and using some of my cash to pay taxes.  I owe be converting at at 24% federal and 5% state tax rate. I can't figure out if this makes sense or not.  

I do have a goal of leaving my kids and grandkids a decent portion of the estate (unless of course one of us ends up in a nursing home, in which case we would be broke very quickly).

Thanks in advance for any advice.  I have found this group very helpful.

Retirement homes really small or really big,"I’m wondering how many people now retired have elected to live in a “tiny home”, where tiny home is defined as 400 sq ft (37 sq m) or less. How are you enjoying it? Any thoughts about whom this lifestyle would be best suited for? 

Likewise for any retirees who are the primary residents in a “really big” home, where let’s call that 5000 sq ft interior space or more. What led you to choose a space that large, and what are the upsides and downsides of that? How are you enjoying it?

(Just to be clear, I know most retirees are in the big range in between -- 400 sq ft to 5000 sq ft -- but I'd like to focus on the responses by the people on either end of that bell curve.)"

How does an FSA work when you retire after having funded it?,"If I elect to fund my FSA in November of 2024 for 2025, then retire in 2025, how does an employer generally treat that situation?

Should I use Roth as Emergency fund?,"Approaching 59 1/2 in a couple months.  I have Regular and Roth IRAs (and 401k etc.), in addition to cash emergency funds in a savings account that isn't paying that much. Current Roth account houses about 4 months of salary, emergency savings about 3 months worth.

Is there any reason I should not use a portion of my emergency $ to fund my Roth this year? I could tap the Roth in the event of emergency, and the account with the emergency funds isn't really making me any money anyway. Seems redundant with no real benefit, when I would be able to use Roth money without penalty."
Any ideas for coping with being a “lame duck” for 1-2 years before retiring?,"I sold the business I founded and have committed to staying on with the acquiring company for another 1.5-2 years. (In my business this is common.) I had deep ambivalence about selling, but a few months in, things are going well, and my new “bosses” are fine. But I have days when I feel anxious, trapped, and bored. My timeline for retirement is not widely known, but it probably comes down to the fact that I still feel like a lame duck.

I have less influence inside the organization than I once did, and I’m simply not that invested in this new company’s future. At the same time, I want to be productive and to be seen as contributing. I can retire earlier than planned, but I would probably be leaving $ on the table, and I’m not miserable, so I should probably ride it out. But I’ve never been a clock-watcher, and, counting down the days on a mental calendar is making me feel guilty and worthless. It’s affecting my confidence, making me feel old and irrelevant. (No one‘s being disrespectful, and some of this is likely in my head, but let’s face it, I will be out of here soon… but not that soon.)

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Any strategies for feeling useful, or, conversely, shrugging it off and not feeling guilty? I’ve basically busted my butt my whole career, and I look forward to retirement but at the same time it’s frustrating to be in this kind of limbo."

IRA/ 401K Withdrawal 4% rule-of-thumb,"There is a common rule-of thumb that 4% can be withdrawn from a IRA or 401K account each year in retirement, and the balance of the account should not go down.  

What would be the reasons for a retired person not withdrawing that much from the IRA or 401K each year?  

I would think that one reason would be that a person might want to increase withdrawals in the future to keep up with inflation, and that might not be possible if one starts at the 4% level.   Is that a concern?  
When withdrawing at the 4% level, can one expect the account balance and future withdrawals to actually increase to keep up with inflation?  

Thank you."

Tip for those about to retire -- try to get laid off,"When you're ready to tell your employer that you're going to retire have a private conversation with somebody up your chain of command who is high enough to be a decision maker (in other words -- not supervisors of middle managers is you can help it).  Tell them you're thinking of retiring but don't announce a date, and ask if there are any layoffs coming up that you can volunteer for.  Do this even if your employer doesn't have a policy allowing folks to volunteer for layoffs.

I did this and my director, who couldn't come out and say directly that a layoff was coming within a couple of months, gave me enough hints that I said, ""put me on the list you can't tell me about"".  I ended up staying on a couple of months past my intended retirement date, waiting for the layoff. A week or so before the layoff the director told me it was coming and, of course, told me not to say anything to anyone.

With some luck you'll get severance and unemployment to ease your way into retirement.  The director thanked me because I was one person he didn't have to feel bad about laying off.  Win win. 

The only downside is that you won't get any going-away party and it feels very weird knowing something bad is going to happen to your co-workers (kind of like one of those time travel movies where the time traveler goes on the Titanic)."

"Two Dilemmas--To quit, or to ""wind down"". Whether to take fixed distributions","I have two issues regarding my plunge into retirement. I have reached the point where retirement is a viable  financial option. In fact, if I am to be honest with myself, I have to admit that I have kept working as long as I have due to a lack of courage, or imagination, or both. But now that I am committed to retiring, I am trying to solve two issues.

First--I am a lawyer in sole practice. I stopped taking new work about four months ago, and cases are dropping out of my life as they are resolved (my practice is almost entirely litigation).  I can't decide whether to set a definite retirement date, or just work my current cases until they are all gone. On one hand, I might find that a gradual drawdown in my work will help ease me into retirement. On the other hand, perhaps a long leash (a steadily decreasing number of open cases) is as bad as a short one (a full-time caseload).   My business overhead is so low as not to be a factor in my decision.

Second--I have a taxable mutual fund portfolio that has, for three of the last four years produced enough in the way of  capital gain/dividend distributions to cover all our bills. However, the distributions are very irregularly made during the year.  I get about 2/3 of the distributions in December, another 20% or so in June, and the remainder in very small dribs and drabs during the remainder of the year. I can't decide if I should just take the distributions in cash as they are declared (I started doing this about a year ago), or instead instruct the mutual fund manager to send me a set amount of money each month, and reinvest the monthly distributions (as I had done for 30 years).

Thoughts on either topic?"
In the years leading up - Wiki Wednesday Part 5 - 2.2024,"Life can be busy leading up to retirement. Hours at work, hobbies, family commitments, and also managing the moving parts to our retirement goal. It can be daunting.

Deep in the content of a favorite blog (listed in our [WIKI](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/wiki/index/)) , [The Retirement Manifesto](https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com) , is an invaluable pre retirement checklist (in addition to great posts and worksheet there). It is something I recommend to everyone - [https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com/the-ultimate-pre-retirement-checklist-an-infographic/](https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com/the-ultimate-pre-retirement-checklist-an-infographic/) .

The blogger, Fritz, also published a short easy to read book.

About the book in his words: Like my blog, the book focuses on both the “Hard” (financial) and “Soft” (lifestyle) issues related to retirement.  However, I found the process of writing a book significantly different than writing my blog posts.  Writing the book allowed me to be more expansive, to more thoroughly examine relevant topics, and to organize my thoughts into a broader perspective than is possible in a 1,500-word post. The book isn’t long, and that’s by design. It’s meant to be read and applied, quickly and easily, by folks who are +/- 5 years of their retirement date.  It’s a lot of the stuff that matters, and not much of the stuff that doesn’t.

Here is an Amazon link to it - [Keys to a Successful Retirement](https://www.amazon.com/dp/164611339X/?tag=retirementm01-20)

Recorded during the lockdown, this long in-depth interview about the book and him is about an hour and a half , and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/lR2nq4Hvcns?si=xWQ4X05LHl44jo5S) .

NUA Strategy - Frank Duke Method,"
Has anyone used the NUA (Net Unrealized Appreciation) Strategy for 401k’s with highly appreciated company stock?  If so, did you use the Frank Duke or standard method?  I’m curious how popular this strategy is for tax efficiency planning.  I’m surprised that I haven’t seen it discussed in any FP or FI threads, so I’m curious if the already retired community has any thoughts.  

Prior to preparing for retirement I had no idea this strategy even existed.  I know that it is only pertinent to those with a concentrated company stock position, so this may have a very limited audience."
Identity/What do you do?.......,"For most of my adult life I purposely asked people the very vague question ""What do you do?"". With very few exceptions the reply was the work that they did.

My question is, if our work is our identity, how do you folks who have been retired for some time now identify yourself or construct your identity in retirement ?"

Transition - how many weeks? The Gift of the Magi,"Life of the Newly Retired – I may be turning into fodder for the Progressive commercial about your parents. 
  
I was “retired” by virtue of a RIF at the beginning of this year, so while it worked out for me on the severance package, it wasn’t entirely on my time line.  Nevertheless, I just turned 65, so that part was helpful. 

I spent this morning trying to get the SS form SSA-44 filled out correctly.  I know that what the IRS shows I made in 2022 was pretty sweet, (some nice commissions along the way) but it isn’t close to what is coming in for 2024!   Trying to get the Modified Adjusted Gross Income (the acronym is MAGI – nothing like magic – and no genies or wise men as far as I can tell) for Medicare Part B.  All estimations at this time, which makes you run the numbers several times!  Really, that is the income for 2024?  Hmmm. 

  
Later, I took a load of books to donate to the library.  They were all business/coaching/get organized/work more efficiently/ type books.  Don’t really care about that stuff anymore.  I figured I’ll cull the books now, so my daughter doesn’t have to later.   While I was there, I decided to renew my library card, and check out one of the books recommended on r/retirement at Reddit.  (free – didn’t buy it on Amazon, like I would have a month or so ago)  “Four Thousand Weeks, Time Management for Mortals” by Oliver Burkeman. 


  
Then I took a few boxes of business clothes to the thrift shop. Since I was there, and didn’t have to get on a Zoom call, or be back in my office for anything, I shopped around a bit, and found some “deals” for the casual clothes I need now.  (Don’t tell my daughter I'm shopping the thrift shop) 


This retirement thing is definitely an interesting transition.  Last month, I **bought that book** (""Transitions"" by William Bridges) on Amazon, based on a recommendation on r/retirement.  So,  I think I'm making progress by getting the library card, right?

Retirees barely making it: What tricks and tips for getting by do you know?,"First off, please ward off any shame about this. If you are having a tough time with financial survival in retirement, **you are not alone**. Also, please remember that those who share a common problem can help each other by sharing what works for them, and what choices are involved -- so help a brother or a sister out. You may also be taking advantage of a resource that others haven't learned about yet, and which would make their lives easier if they only knew about it. Lastly, some of you may have discovered that cutting back to simpler living has turned out to be an unexpected blessing, and that the things of value actually don't require money at all. "
Short term rentals for possible retirement or winter locations,"How do you find places to rent for 2-3 weeks without using Airbnb or other sites? I find their prices really high (often over $1k/week) which limits how many places I can check out. I like to cook and feel that hotels insulate you from the vibe of a place. But the fees and extra charges from many of the larger online sites is off-putting. Looking for any tips or alternatives.

There really is no magic reward for waiting 8 more months until full retirement age, it’s only like $80 a month more. I’m thinking to do it by April."
Retirement Transition: What made it easier or provided purpose?,"Maybe those are two different things - I'm not sure. However, we have discussed the transition into retirement and how it's often not as easy, joyful, or smooth as people dream about.

I retired as of the first of the year so I am not far along in the process (also had a bout of Covid, which knocked me on my rear for a couple of weeks). However, I do have one thing that I have done consistently which has been extremely rewarding.

I enjoy reading greatly but I missed out on a lot of classics, so I joined an online slow read of War & Peace. You read a chapter a day. Most translations have appx 361 chapters, so it works out to a year of reading. The person who runs it then posts daily chats and weekly rounds-ups.

It has been fulfilling and interesting to me. It also gives me a great sense of accomplishment.

And then one day, 18 months ago it all stopped. It's weird. I have the resources to do almost anything, but mostly I'm bored. I feel like I should be doing something, and yet I don't want to do anything. I can go days without talking to anyone except my wife. 

I'm not really looking for advice. Maybe some empathy."
"I can move anywhere, but I don't know where to go","Sorry for the long post. I feel overwhelmed researching places to retire to. I have always moved somewhere because of my family, school, or work. I have never had the freedom to just move anywhere. It is like looking at a restaurant menu with too many things to choose from.   
  
I am 55 and am planning to retire in the next 4 or 5 years. Sooner if my company gives me a decent package. I am single, have never been married and have no dependents. I don’t plan on ever getting married at this point.   
  
A little background on me. I was born in New York and lived in Connecticut and New Jersey as a kid. I moved to Illinois for college and lived in the Chicago area (city and then suburbs) for over 25 years. 10 years ago, I moved to Sarasota, FL for work. I know this is a place where many people retire and while I do like it here, it just isn’t my ideal place. I don’t like the beach and while I don’t like the bitter cold anymore, I enjoy some fluctuation in the weather. It has also gotten so crowded and overbuilt in the 10 years I have been here. I get a knot in my stomach at the start of every hurricane season that doesn’t go away until it’s over. I was here for Irma and Ian, which had rather significant impacts on my area. I didn’t sustain any damage to my house, but I was without power for 5 days after the last one. My homeowner’s insurance has nearly quadrupled over the last 8 years. Car insurance is also outrageous down here.   
  
I have done OK in the real estate market in Sarasota. I bought a house in 2016 for $314k that I sold in 2022 for $600k. I moved my mom down here in 2021 after my dad passed and bought her a nice house in a gated community for $330k. She moved to assisted living last year and I moved into that house. I am not going to abandon my mom down here, but her health is getting worse by the day, unfortunately. ☹ The house is probably worth around $450-500k now as the market has declined a bit since I sold my other house. I do not have a mortgage. My property taxes are somewhat reasonable (at least in comparison to Illinois), at about $3400 a year. I am in a very restrictive HOA now. I am not opposed to being in an HOA, but it would have to be less restrictive than the one I am in now. I am the treasurer (soon to be president) of the board of my HOA.  
  
I really don’t want to live in a major metro area. I want a nice small city or town, in a quaint scenic area. An hour or slightly more to an airport with connections to a couple of major hubs would be preferred. I love dive bars, live music, checking out restaurants, bird watching, casual bike riding and hanging out at home listening to my vinyl collection. Ideally, I would like a house surrounded by trees or a nice view, but within a short drive or Uber ride (if I have spent too much time in a dive bar) to town. A couple of good, friendly neighborhood taverns are a must. I don't require much in the way of healthcare right now, but I haven't exactly lived a heathy lifestyle, so future needs are a concern.   
  
The states I have been looking at so far are Georgia (northern), Alabama (northern), Arkansas, Tennessee (eastern), North Carolina (western), and South Carolina (western). I haven’t really thought about Mississippi. I have visited all these states on business over the years, but mostly in the larger cities. Some random places that have popped up in my searches are Guntersville, AL, Brevard, NC, Hendersonville, NC, Murphy, NC, Hot Springs, AR, Eureka Springs, AR, Blue Ridge, GA, Ellijay, GA, among many others. This is a sampling of places I think I might like but have never been to. Greenville, SC is also on the list and I have visited here many times. It might be a little larger than I would like. A long day’s drive to the Chicago area to see friends would be a plus, but not a requirement. Nothing near a coast where there is a possibility of a major hurricane. I obviously need to visit some of these places, but I am trying to narrow down my search a little.   
  
I tend to lean on the conservative side politically.   
  
Ideally, I would like to sell my house for $500k (who knows what it will be worth 4 years from now) and buy a house for that amount. If I need to spend a little out of savings that is fine. Not having state income tax in Florida is nice and believe Tennessee is the only state on my list that does not, so a favorable tax climate is preferred. Reasonable property and home/car insurance as well.

What factors did you consider in determining when to take Social Security?,"I know that there’s lots of advice out there and of course much of it is contradictory. And also, there’s no “one-size-fits-all” answer. So I’m curious what all went into your determination for when to start taking payments.

I just turned 61 and plan to retire a year from now.  My wife is exactly one week younger than me (so for one week she calls me an old man) and will retire in the summer of 2025. I make over twice as much as her since she works in the public school system. 

All along, I assumed that we would both draw SS ASAP. Having recently watched the new Mike Piper video, I am seriously considering putting my SS benefits off until 70 and supplementing my pension and her SS with distributions from a 401K bond fund while letter my S&P fund continue to grow. 

So my real question is: What factors went into your decision making?  I want to consider as many variables as possible. 

TBH, the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs are just filler because a mod bot told me that posts should be at least 350 characters."
Impact of inflation on retirement funding plans,"So I have a realistic budget built and was analyzing my required yearly withdrawals from my retirement along with social security etc.  I made an assumption of 4%inflation each year.  Looking ten years out this really required some significant increases in my yearly retirement withdrawal requirements.  Is this realistic?  How are folks factoring inflation into their planning?  Appreciate any input, thanks much!"
"Tax efficient retirement distributions *LIVE (only) webinar, Monday February 5","Taxes. If you are thinking about how to plan for them while in retirement this live webinar might be for you. I see people commenting in our community and others like it, on this topic. A common refrain is, sometimes frustrating and can be difficult. It is *personal* finance , after all .

I am finding that locating resources about them for the DIY‘er, do it yourself , is not easy. So I was pleased when I  heard about this webinar. In my experience with the delivery and normal material of the presenter, I expect quality content.

The  presenter  is  Dr. Wade Pfau. We have many things of  his  in  the [r/retirement WIKI](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/wiki/index/) ,  as  it  should  be.  He has an impressive background. What I often  see  written about  him  -  does  not  even cover  half  of  it  and  neither  will  this  one. He  has  a  Phd  from  Princeton  in  economics  where  his dissertation was about the proposal to create personal retirement accounts from Social Security.  Did an  internship  at  social  security. He  spends  most  of  his  time  researching retirement  income. Additionally, he is a Professor at the American College of Financial Services. I think you would be hard pressed to find someone else with such depth and breadth on retirement income planning.

I suspect the target audience is at a minimum, a level that is one step up from a beginner. Here is the description provided: In this presentation, I will describe how to use tax maps and effective marginal tax rate management to look for tax planning opportunities with spending between taxable brokerage accounts, tax-deferred retirement plans, and tax-exempt Roth accounts to support greater after-tax returns to your retirement portfolio. I cover pitfalls with generating more taxable income, including the issue of preferential income (long-term capital gains and qualified dividends) stacking on top of ordinary income, the Social Security tax torpedo, and increased Medicare premiums. You will learn why it is important to plan ahead for the impact of requirement minimum distributions from your tax-deferred accounts. I finish with a detailed case study to show how more tax-efficient retirement distributions using strategic Roth conversions can significantly extend retirement portfolio longevity.

2nd and 3rd interview. Do I really want to ditch retirement?,"I have interviews today and Monday with one of the Big4 accounting firms today. I retired 3 months ago. I retired because I felt marginalized. 

I am not sure if they found me on LinkedIn or I found them. I saw the job listing and I recognized that they were looking for exactly what I did which is a tax credit for really large firms. 

I have been sitting here in front of my fireplace, dragging in wood, and trying to find some volunteer work at the ieee for these three months. I have set up to do a webinar on my topic, but there doesn't seem to be a huge amount of interest, at least that's my perception.

Anyway, do I want this job, if offered? To me it depends on the commute. I am sure the pay will be fine. The job requires 20% travel. No people management. And I sure miss the interactions with people."
What to do with a 401k after retirement?,"My plan is to retire in April 2024.  Two years ago I converted my 401K into an IRA but I continued to fund the 401k (so I would continue getting matching funds by my company).  So the 401K will be about 70k when I retire.  For the short term (rest of 2024) I plan on living on savings and apply for SS and start withdrawals from IRA in 2025.  I'd like the 70k to be in a safe space with little risk and sort of keep it for very last resort money.  What do you all suggest?  CD's, T-Bills or something else?  I suspect CD rates will start going down when the Fed eventually reduces rates.  Thanks for your advice."
How many of you stayed in the homes where you raised your kids vs downsizing?,"Background: our house should be paid off by the time we retire. We have raised a pack of kids, one has boomeranged back and the youngest is still in college. The others are out on their own. 

We are really trying to decide if we're going to keep the house where we have raised our kids or downsize. As of now, it looks like we will stay in our current city.

My partner loves the house, sees no significant downside to having some unused rooms ( one now is a home office, one is a guest room, another they say can be a craft room or something, etc ). They also think that the headache and cost of moving will be more of a headache than keeping up where we are. House is ranch style , and we could age in place.

Vs

I'm feeling that it would be smarter to move to a much smaller house or even townhome. Less upkeep. Lower utilities, etc and, we have a lot of land. Great while the kids were running wild on it but we don't really use it now. There is a guest house on the property that the boomerang child is currently renting. But once they go? More unused space. Neither of us are keen on dealing with it as a rental.

So, for those that raised children in a house over a long period of time AND STAYED IN THE SAME CITY, did you stay in it upon retiring or downsize?"
"Start to worry about RMDs now, or wait to be socked with taxes in my 70s?","I am 60 years-old and retired.  I have about $800k in \[traditional\] IRAs and about $700k in brokerage accounts.

Should I start drawing on my IRA's now, or should I leave it to grow and draw from my after-tax brokerage accounts?

I have a pension, so my marginal federal tax rate for the IRA withdrawal is 22%.

The commonsense thing seems to leave the money in there as long as possible, but will I get hit with a tax bomb in 15 years when RMDs start?

[OP comments]

I posted to r/investing and received lots of good suggestions as well as from this sub. Thank you all. 

Based on the suggestions, this is my new plan:

* Take $15k every year from an inherited IRA.  (this will meet the RMD)
* Take $15k every year from my brokerage account.
* Do a Roth conversion every year for $40k.

The consensus is that I do not have to worry about a tax bomb since I will not ever have enough income to bump me into the really high brackets.

My threshold tax rate is 22%. If I can get the money out at that rate or lower, I will withdraw or Roth convert.  If the tax rate will be higher, I will let it ride.

I thought a thread might be welcome. Reminder you must be a member to have comments show to others and as always- no politics.

Few things. - I am too young yet to claim but yes interested in knowing more. - I learned you can start when you are 62, BUT it has to be for the entire month so for me with a bday more toward the middle, that means the month after. That was news to me. - Also the interview began with a discussion on survivor benefits and then discussed spousal benefits. He stated they ARE different things.

Have a good day!"

How can I preserve a that has no COLA?,"Hi everyone!

In order to preserve the buying power of a pension that has no cost of living adjustment, what percentage of the pension should be reinvested in the market each year? 

Suppose the pension is $40,000 and inflation runs at 3%. 

Also assume the market returns a conservative 5%. What would the formula be in order to figure this out? Consider the length of pension buying power preservation needed to be 35 years.Hypothetical scenario that an above defined formula might produce:

Year #1 I would collect $40,000 and the amount I might be able to spend would be $35,000 because based on the formula I need to invest the $5,000 into the market (5% return) so that the next year I could spend $35,000 of the $40,000 plus draw 3% from the market fund ($1,050) in order to keep up with inflation and preserve the buying power.

End of year #1 the market account balance would be $4200. Initial year of $5,000 deposit from pension minus end of year withdraw of $1,050 for year #2 buying power preservation, plus $250 market 5% return.

Year #2 I would collect $40,000 Spend would be $35,000 (plus $1,050 from the market fund to keep up with the 1rst year of inflation) and invest the $5,000 into the market fund which would grow to $9,476 at end of year #2 (which includes $275 --  5% return)

Year #3 I would need to collect $1,081.50 from the market account which would reflect the 3% for $36,050 from previous inflation adjusted amount. etc etc etcI just do not know the ""math"" to get the formula to figure out what the investment amount is to maintain the buying power.

Good News! Retired living really is cheaper.,"For those who are anxious about whether they'll have enough money, the good news is that the cost of living generally falls when you retire, for a lot of reasons. Here's a list of things that pertain to me, and maybe some of these are ones you also enjoy. Maybe you can suggest some others.

* No longer have to set aside money for savings accounts or for retirement funds.
* No longer pay life insurance premiums.
* The car gets driven only half as much these days, so fuel and maintenance costs are lower.
* Our pattern for eating out is mainly just Thursdays, every other week sit-down restaurant, every other week fast food, and the rest of the time is home-cooked (or eating leftovers from the sit-down restaurant). Even grocery bills are a lot lower now that young Hoovers are out.
* We no longer need new things for the house and are in a replace-as-necessary-only mode.
* No more new books, just reading what I've already collected and books from the library.
* No more house payments, no more car payments -- debt free.
* Trips are a lot less involved and expensive, first because it's just the two of us, and usually within a 2-hour drive.
* No more new clothes needed, except as a rare indulgence.
* Medical deductibles are lower.
* No more ancillary work expenses, like eating lunch or having drinks with colleagues.
* Discount tickets to movies and other events because old. National Parks lifetime pass included in that.
* Gym membership is cheap and walking is a great way to stay healthy at this age.
* Surprised to discover that charitable giving has gone down, because now there is time to support charitable causes with volunteering and direct involvement instead of just writing a check (which I'd do when I had no time to help).
* Children are launched and supporting themselves. No college costs, no subsidizing."
2 years to go. Burned out. What to do?,"So I’ve got 2 years and 3 months to retirement.   2.5 years ago I took a role in a different gubment department to try and ease the boredom.  I went from boredom every day to working in a team of 3 doing the work of 7.  After 2.5 years of watching high turnover and burning myself out I have a chance to take a role with a previous director for slightly less money which is inconsequential to my situation.  My issue is I’ve developed a loyalty to my current director as a result of the impossible workload we all share.  I know this is unhealthy for me but guilt of leaving her in the lurch is killing me.   I know I am right that I should leave because it’s clear to me resources will never be made available. Snap me out of this please.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the feedback.  I was already moving in that direction.  I guess I should confirm that my team is 3 people TRYING to do the work of 7.  We never make it, and I can see this situation is taking its toll on people.   As an Enterprise Architect I can confirm I have my retirement all planned. I really wanted to thank everyone for the responses.   It's always good to hear the wisdom of others. I'll post again in 2 years when I get there.

Selling/Moving Dilemma Advice/Experience?,"I will be retiring December of this year. Husband retired a few years ago. We are not yet collecting SS since I'm working full time and there's no need to yet.

We have a home that we will be selling and moving slightly further south in the same state we're in (NJ). Only reason for moving is the house is almost 100 years old and while we've done a ton of work on it over the years, it still needs a lot more to make it livable for aging in place. Like, way too much money to make sense especially since we still have a mortgage. There are issues which can't be resolved like a detached garage (getting into the car when it snows is a real problem) and the laundry is in the unfinished basement. Another big one is our main bathroom needs a gut job. There's plenty more than this but those are the big three.

We're looking at 55+ communities an hour or so south from where we are now. We like the idea of being able to get to the beach within 20 minutes without parkway traffic to bother. I have siblings that live down in that area so it would be nice to be closer to family.

The dilemma is if it would make more sense to first find a new home (or rent short term?) and put our house for sale after we've settled in. I think our home would show much better empty or staged. Another problem is we have cats and the thought of having people come in and us having to figure out what to do with them (dogs much easier in this kind of situation!) seems too daunting a task for us. I do not trust people to come in and not be careful about letting them get out. And of course having to keep the house in ""show"" condition at all times - I just don't see how we can manage that as I'm still working and the house is after all, lived in.

We could probably swing buying a new home while waiting for ours to sell (we have a lot of cash on hand and could take a small bridge loan if need be) but certainly would start getting worried if the house sits on the market longer than expected. Our area has low inventory, the house is comparable to most in the neighborhood and it's still a sellers market but that guarantees nothing. As it is, most likely wouldn't even think of making any move until I finish working at the end of this year.

So I'm curious how others handled this and how it worked out for you. My husband seems to think all of this is ""no big deal"" and will somehow will magically resolve on it's own but he's not the one who plans everything for us.  I'm super detail oriented and have bought/sold before whereas he hasn't so I keep seeing all the possible pitfalls.

Thanks!

What types of part-time jobs do people do in retirement?,"More specifically, if you had a higher level or analytical type of job prior to retirement, what kind of part-time work are you doing now?  I am not interested in customer-facing, minimum wage jobs and there is no possibility of going part-time where I am currently employed.  Just trying to figure out how I can make extra money once retired because even if I work until 70, I will likely not have enough saved."
Future retirement financial nervousness,"Many of you have likely dealt with this. Planning to retire in 18 months or so. I have run and re-run my financial numbers several times, and while I will definitely have less income, it should be plenty. Talked to a financial advisor who I know well, and they agree: it should be plenty.

Despite this, can't seem to shake the nerves about being in a position where I'm drawing from savings I've built over 40 years. Having saved money has always helped me feel secure, in that I can care for myself and am not dependent upon my spouse or anybody else. But when I retire, those numbers will
decrease over time! Makes me irrationally nervous.

Guess this is just a vent, as I'm sure
many if you have worked through this."
No more Sunday Blues! Upside of recent retirement,"Just retired January 1.  Tonight I realized I am enjoying cooking dinner, while being totally relaxed and watching football games with my husband and NOT worried about what I need to be thinking of in advance of tomorrow morning.  

I had several people reporting to me and I traveled a lot to work with direct reports.  What a nice relief to not be checking flights and packing my suitcase tonight! 

I’m still getting used to this strangeness of not working, but I definitely don’t miss the Sunday Blues!   
Have a good week everyone!"
Retirement and children with special needs,"I'd like to learn from those already retired and have adult children with special needs. I'm heading towards 64 and am still working, but the retirement bug has bit. 

My daughter is 32 and has Downs Syndrome. She goes to an adult daycare three days a week and music classes on the weekends. Special Olympics hasn't taken off, post-Covid. She swaps weeks between my house and her mother's.

Would you be able to share any insight into how's it going once you get into retirement? Anything that's different (or the same?) I know that all of our kids and families are different, but hoping to learn.

Edit: Thanks for the comments and suggestions. Her Mom and I are somewhat aware of group homes, but in my state, Colorado, state-funded resources are scarce and we think private homes are very expensive. However, until we really know the facts, we won't really know. Anyone from Colorado out there?

Edit 2: Thanks again for the feedback and the specifics. Having split households has made things a bit more complicated but seeing how you and your families are navigating the system helps make it seem more doable."
"Just retired, should we buy a Class B??","Note: 
Class B is an RV purpose built van for camping. It’s slightly larger than a regular van. 

A Class B+ is based on a van but then the back is removed and a camper is built in the frame. It’s a little larger than a Class B. 
***
Wife has an arthritic condition and we have 2 small dogs. Recently, I’ve driven the dogs to destinations and she flys there. 

Now we are formally retired and expect to travel a lot more. 

Does anyone have an opinion about buying a Class B versus anything else? 

I think a Class B+ is too large and we would likely stay in hotels most of the time and use the sleeping part for rests or convenience. 

It’s a lot of money but I have two challenges to solve - the dogs and her pain levels.

Thank you everyone for your replies. I’ve learned a lot from each of you.

Recommendations for retirement planning guides (withdrawal/tax strategies),"Hi, looking for some recommendations for books, etc, to guide investment/withdrawal strategies in early retirement to minimize taxes. etc. I am 57 and planning to retire at 60.  My husband will continue working for another 5 years, until he reaches 60. We don't have children so leaving an inheritance is not much of a concern and our mortgage will be paid off in about 3 years.

Most of the money is in my own retirement accounts, my husband is not much of a saver but he will get a decent pension when he retires. We have been working with a fee-based financial advisor for about a year (1% of AUM, which is in IRAs (We also have separate 401ks).    It's been good and we were able to make some adjustments based on his advice, but I understand how that 1% will impact compounding over time and I'd like to learn enough to manage things myself. 

I do expect to earn some income from part-time work for about 5 years after retiring, and also have some income from a rental property (which we will likely sell once my husband retires).  I anticipate taking SS at 67, although that could be deferred depending on how things stand at that point.  I am likely to begin withdrawing some money from retirement accounts when I retire to finance travel and other activities. 

I have found many resources on saving for retirement based on expected expenses (4% rule, etc.), but not much on optimizing investing and withdrawal strategies, tax implications, etc. once you are retired, and particularly when you are in the gap between retirement and collecting SS.  I read Jane Bryant Quinn's book but it really did not have what I was looking for.  I'd appreciate any resources this group could point me toward.  TIA."
"How to retire with low income, too late to plan ahead","I'm about to reach full retirement age for Soc. Security.  I've been working in a kitchen for the past few years and it's now gotten too physically demanding. I'm just about to pay off debts and I will have 30K in saving.  I live by myself and nearly rent free (I'm very fortunate with that).

So...  what to do?  Like a lot of people in hospitality/restaurants,  I've never made much money so my lifestyle is simple.  My only addiction is caffeine.  For the last year I've been living on what my Soc. Security will be and I may even be able to save a little.   Maybe I can be a sub at work once the ""fun"" part of retirement wears off.  Or find some other part time/occasional work.  I have a couple of creative projects to work on and I want to do some cheap international travel like I did decades ago.  

I'm a little nervous about all this, I've been working almost 50 years and I'm a little overwhelmed by what will happen.  Just thinking about not having to do anything, be anywhere sounds like some fantasy to me.  My work/life balance has been terrible and right now my free time is resting enough to survive another work week.

Most advice on the internet is how to plan for retirement for the next 10, 20, 30 years.  Too late for me.  I've got to figure this out now.

\-Any advice?"
Car replacement before retirement,"Hello everyone,
I will be 63 this year and wanting some advice.  
Currently have a 2016 vehicle with 167,000 miles and wondering if I should upgrade before retiring.  
I drive about 25,000 miles a year for work.
I plan on working as long as I am able or as long as the company will keep me. 

Should I upgrade to a new vehicle or keep what I have?

Thank you for your advice"
When do you stop investing in a 401k or IRA?,"I've taken all my 401k and rolled it over into an IRA in Vanguard. Now Vanguard is suggesting I contribute to an IRA. Is that a good idea? Will it reduce my taxes or income?

I don't expect I'll need any of the money in the next few years. Do people keep investing in IRAs at the start of retirement? And RMD is a long way off. 

I'm not planning on investing any more in the 401k. I run a company and will be closing it end of Q1. I've stopped investing in the 401k to stop the fees. The company does match, but I own the company, so I don't gain anything and I save on fees for one quarter."
I am wondering how I can learn moves like these?,"
As I sit here in front of my fireplace, dealing with the 'grey', I have been getting infatuated with dance. When I was in my 20's I used to go to the Joyce Theatre in NY occasionally to see modern dance. There is something about the combo of music and movement that I find fascinating. I stopped.going to see dance once I got married. And now a trip to Manhattan is a major task. 

I am 65 now and would love to move like this. How does one learn to do this at this late stage?

"Part time job fail, too soon after retirement?","After being retired about a month, I accepted a part time job that would utilize the skills I acquired during my career. People told me to wait before I made any commitments, but I didn't listen. The job was difficult and in a field I had no experience in and the person training me was a tad hostile and not a good trainer. It was just as, if not more, stressful than my full time job was. I let them know I was considering resigning and why which was a mistake. Some of the things I said were pretty direct. A couple of days later they asked me to resign. Now I know that I wasn't ready to determine what I wanted to do next after retiring, and took the job because I was so uncomfortable (emotionally) not working. I was never a workaholic, but I can see tendencies that are similar. I didn't need the new job and had no incentive to tolerate the dysfunction. Any similar experiences? I'm feeling pretty shell shocked, and while working full time didn't have negative experiences like this. Thanks much."
Retiring before 65 and Medicare - the health insurance gap,"We'll both be 60 this year and I'm 100% ready for retirement. My job sucks and I don't want to do it any more, and we've got ample assets.

The trick is health insurance between now and Medicare at \~65. We have three kids, one of whom ages off my employer-provided health insurance this year, one in 2026 and the last not until 2029. I'd hate to kick them off so I can retire.

We'd have to go onto ""Obamacare"" too and I'm concerned the expense compared to my employer-provided insurance would so huge I'd be better off toughing it out. Additionally, we have an HSA that we're using as a retirement fund, and that goes away if I retire.

Any advice/suggestions? Thanks in advance.

How do you deal with the “grey” ?,"Anyone else tired of it? What do you do? 

I wake up snuggled under my covers - a decent sheet set with a crocheted Blanket on top. It is dark. I think should I try to sleep some more? 

A little time later, my bedroom door …  rattles. Someone is trying to come in but the door stays. That is the cats. Not a typo! They have figured out how to turn the doorknob (which I never imagined possible before I had cats). But it gives me motivation to get out of bed.

I wander down the hall , turning lights on as I go. I spy in the shadows their half eaten dry food bowl. Today I choose to ignore it, for now. 

I Need my morning beverage. Be it coffee or tea , I have to jump start my mind . Check reddit :) Awhile later I reluctantly reach out and open the blinds to the world. 

I sigh.

It is day. But oh what a sight. There are sad barren trees, no color in the landscape, and the white wash remnants of road salt. The sun, if I can even see it, is hazy.

In the afternoon I take a phone call from a relative. They escaped and now living in a year round warmer place. They just finished golfing and share their day.

They ask “how is the weather? It is sunny and 70s here.”

I say one word 

“Grey” 

They don’t reply. As a former midwesterner they know…

It is just months of grey."
Trouble applying for just Medicare A,"I'm on my husband's anthem from his old job as a cop although he retired 5 years ago. I tried to apply to Medicare A and it said are you on your own policy at work, I said No. It said are you on spouse's. I said Yes. When did he start work and did he end. I said yes. It stops there saying I can't say I have insurance with him if he's not working. Thousands are on policies with state and cities from retirement. Where is the best place to get help. So hard to call anyone when I work in a medical office. Any advice/help? I stayed online 45 min for SS to tell me I should make an appt because they couldn't help me. Then asked if I wanted to do a survey on my experience. : ("
Why the ubiquitous & loud obsession over taxes when retirement income is lower?,"Having had some good fortune while working, especially in my last three years, my estimated retirement income is \~72% less than while working.  Accordingly, my income tax rates should also plummet as well (nominal rate to go from second highest to second lowest). Meanwhile, retirement literature is obsessed with taxes, and is telling me I should be freaking out over them. Why?"
5 Year Planning with Unexpected Inheritance,"Husband and I have been planning to retire early in 5 years at age 60. Both of us are government employees and will have enough years for modest, but decent pensions. The idea has been that one of us will take Social Security early, and the other will wait until age 70.

Just recently my husband's remaining parent died and left us with a substantial amount of money we never anticipated [nearly 6 figures].

We have never had this kind of money. What advice would you give for us to safely protect it for our early retirement plan, and also hopefully grow it? Also, do you recommend we hire a financial advisor? If so, how do we find a trustworthy one? What should we plan to pay for their services?"
Do you feel federal retirement benefits have been the investment you hoped for?,
Should I spend my first year of retirement abroad?,"I'm 53 and starting to think about what I will do during retirement at age 62 or 63. I'm thinking about what it would be like to spend my first year of retirement outside the US. I've always wanted to live abroad for a year, to fully learn a new culture and language. I'm leaning towards Latin America as I already have a good start on learning Spanish. I'm curious, have any of you tried living in a different country for an extended time during retirement, rather than occasionally traveling? What are some of the hidden perks/pitfalls that I might not be thinking about?"
Employment status changing soon - Financial Planner vs Advisor?,"I am 56 and work for a large financial institution and will most likely be included in the next round of layoffs. Trying to decide if I simply work with my company provided advisor or if I really should be looking into going to a fiduciary planner instead?

What should I look for in a financial planner and how do I ensure that they have my best interest in mind?

I do intend on looking for another job or to start my own small business or start consulting."
Question on spouse taking SS early and possible income penalty,"My wife is no longer working, so she has no income. She just turned 63. If she starts taking her SS now, does she get penalized for my income if we file taxes jointly? Her difference between taking at 63 and 65 is not that much.

In other words, will she receive her total SS amount (at 63) with0ut any penalty because of my income.

Her amount is close to half of my SS, so I don't think waiting for me makes much of a difference."
What am I going to do with myself?,"I can retire in a year but with one kid just starting college, I’ll likely wait 4 years until I’m 65; besides, I just received a huge pay increase to stay when I was being ‘poached’ by someone else. Saving like a madman!

I’ve worked odd hours, weekends, nights, holidays etc pretty much my whole life and still do. Once I retire, I’ve no clue what to do with my time other than play some golf. I manage a country club and see guys play literally every. single. day…I’m not going to do that.

My wife is 4.5 years behind me and will probably work to 65 as well.

I’d like to find a hobby that won’t require a lot of money/space and perhaps even sell something I can make/do in my spare time. I also plan to learn a language, probably Italian.

Any leads or ideas that might help me sort things? I’m just scratching the surface and have time but would like to spend any necessary funds, get trained, etc whilst still employed.

It was suggested I start a business taking golf groups to Ireland/Scotland as I do that now with club members. I’ve lived in both countries and have travelled there loads of times. It costs me nothing as I charge them enough to cover my costs which don’t amount to much given free golf in most places due to my working in the industry. I just am stumped how to organize that and make money taking strangers.

Sorry for the rambling nature of my request and added info!"
What to do after we reach the TDF end?,"My SO and I both recently retired at 62 however most of our 401Ks are in target date funds for when we turn 67.  Currently we are able to live off SS and pensions and don't need to touch the 401Ks. Given a person may live another 20-30 years or more, do most people here that retired at a similar age do a reset or recalibrate your investments for that 20-30 year time horizon or instead keep the investments in relatively safer vehicles such as bonds? We are looking to leave something to our child."
For those NOT retired yet but who are going to in 2024: what does retirement look like for you?,"I spent some months before I retired thinking seriously about what I wanted retirement life to be like. How much ""home time"" did I want? Did I have big travel aspirations? What kind of people did I want to stay active with? Did I want to work a little bit at something fun? For nominal pay or volunteer? Did I have a major hobby to jump all over? Did I want to move? 

On the other hand, I have a friend I talk to weekly that is getting close to retirement and is having trouble identifying what he and his wife can agree on about retired life. He's actually settling into the pattern I think he'll adopt (IMO), he just doesn't know it yet. 

A lot of retirees feel out of sorts for months either because they didn't think about what they wanted, or because what they chose to do for the first year was unsatisfying, or because they ticked a number of boxes and ended up at ""now what?""

Those people who are planning to retire soon (in the next year), how have you approached thinking about this? Or are you just waiting until the day to see what comes? Do you have any niggling anxiety about how you'll spend your days, and if so then how are you dealing with that?"
Active Retirement Communities and large PETS,"I've been looking specifically at Wisconsin and Michigan, but am open to anything except coastal or hot weather places.

I've been having a hard time finding any such community that allows dogs that weigh over 75 lb., or more than 2 cats.

It seems to me that if I'm paying house level money for a townhouse/house/apartment in an active senior community I should be allowed to have whatever pets I want.  But apparently I can't.

Do any of you know of retirement communities that don't restrict size and/or number of pets?

I've been resisting such communities, but today the snow is hip high outside my front door, and my roof is leaking.  Just don't think I can maintain my house for much longer.  But I'm not going to leave my dog and cats behind."
Have setup a job interview next week,"I retired at the end of October at 65.  I retired because my new boss was micromanaging me and management refused to transfer me to another group.  I left cause my boss was demanding that I be much tougher on audits of clients than was reasonable, imo. I don't like to hurt people, I like to help them. I've been much happier since leaving.

A few weeks ago I saw a job in LinkedIn at one of the big four accounting firms for exactly what I do. In my exact field, just the other side. I originally planned to work until 70. Luckily I inherited a small sum of money, so I reset my sights on 67. 

But I am not sure I want to ""kill myself"" with work and that is what the big 4 are known for.  I would have preferred 20 consulting hours per week. The job pays around 200k. 

I am not sure I really want to go back to working for someone. I have worked independently for the last 18 years. 

Is there any site that deals with consulting work in the taxation world?"
Where should we move to? ... hopefully for the last time!,"My husband and I are 70/66 and fit, athletic and active.  We currently live in a 2 story condo in San Francisco (2 flights of stairs).  We've basically downsized and have very little ""stuff"". We know we need to move to a home without stairs and basically an active community.

We prefer to live with a diversity of ages and backgrounds .... which is what is keeping us from a CCRC?

We feel to young to go to assisted living and yet time is creeping up on us and we'd like to make the transition while we can make new friends and mentally handle it.

No kids to take care of us.  I'll probably live another 15 years after he's gone so looking for that community is important  ....

Advice? Any of you found the magic kingdom?"
W-4P for periodic installments permitted by my 401K plan after retirement.,"My company's 401K plan permits periodic distributions/installments after termination from employment upon reaching early or normal retirement age.  I retired at the normal age last month.

The plan administrator's CSR told me that monthly installments from my 401K are treated essentially the same as a pension for tax purposes so I'm allowed to not have anything withheld on my 2024 W-4P, which is what I did because our MAGI for 2024 (married filing jointly) will be low enough that we probably won't be paying any federal income taxes for 2024.  

I will need to start having some withheld in 2028 after my wife starts collecting her SS benefits in September 2027.  My first RMD won't be until 2031.  My wife never had a 401K or IRA when she was working. 

I will find out if anything was withheld when the money is directly deposited into to my checking account early next month.  I hope nothing will be withheld.  I'll get it back as a refund when filing our 2024 taxes in 2025 if it is.  

Has anyone else chosen to have nothing withheld from their 401K periodic installments?  The IRS rules I've read state that deferred compensation plans qualify for having nothing withheld.  

It would be nice not having to pay federal income taxes on some of my deferred income, at least for a little while :-)"
Modest Pension - Which Option Is Best?,"I worked for a large consultancy long enough to have a modest pension. Most of my savings is in retirement accounts.

Pension doesn’t adjust for inflation, it’s fixed for life. But there are lots of options. I could take a lump sum into a traditional IRA. There are survivorship options galore which reduce the payout considerably. But might be “more fair” if I were to die early. 

I’m looking at all this and wondering what I should do. How to make the decision. This is not a big part of my retirement plan. But not chump change. 

I’m already struggling with a lot of pretax money and how to access it. Cash right now in my 60s is more the challenge. I’m converting traditional to Roth to keep under a tax threshold which is a cash hungry endeavor to pay taxes. Eventually that will end though, and the tax on the pension would drop. Of course the money is worth less every year.

Thinking of taking the one time and just paying myself from the IRA. If I die before my wife she gets it - so it’s fair. And it’s just in our estate and goes to heirs like everything remaining. 

Any thoughts on which is best or how best to make the decision. Any online tools / resources?"
"Now that you're retired, what non-work-related stressful habits or patters are you abandoning?","I gave up essentially all social media a decade ago when I realized I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. My only remaining ones are LinkedIn (which I seldom look at except to track former junior colleagues) and Reddit (with which I have a guarded, restricted relationship ).

I think this year, given warfare breaking out internationally and to some extent domestically, I'll be cutting way back on my news consumption. I just don't need the fray and worry."

Retirement is postponed due to bad/no planning,"I will be 63 this year & hubs is 4 years younger & retired 2 years ago with his pension. We never made saving for retirement a priority, AT ALL. No 401k or savings account. I am still working & am fortunate enough to have a WFH job that pays reasonably well & that I can continue working until whenever. When hubs was working we had money to burn & a lot of it was spent on development of a small cattle farm which was going to be part of our retirement income. We were just beginning to show a profit & thought things were going well. Then we were audited for 4 years of taxes & unfortunately our state screwed us & decided we were a “hobby farm” & not a legitimate farm as we didn’t borrow any money to make our operation happen. We had to hire an attorney & ended up paying a bunch of money to settle. So discouraging & it feels like we were targeted for not taking out an ag loan. We still owe some money on our house & farm land that hopefully will be paid off before I retire. We still have our cattle & sell a few calves every 6 months or so & have signed a lease for our farm land for solar power generation. We can continue to use the farm land for our cattle until they begin construction which could be up to 5 years. Right now our priority is getting our debt paid off. Hubs is trying to get back in the job market but it’s tough since he’s been out for 2 years & his pension restricts him from working in certain fields that are similar to what he retired from. We are both in good health & live in a low cost of living area so that’s a plus. Sorry for the long rambling post but just felt the need to vent. Therapy costs money 🤣"
"Pension: I know the ""gross"". What will I ""net""?","I'm not great with numbers, and not financially all that savy, so here goes. Please be kind. 🤓

I'm almost 60. I'm planning to retire next year.

I have 32 years in a state pension (and other investments).

I have done the state's benefits estimator. I know that I'll be ""grossing"" about $6,500 a month, but trying to guestimate how much of that will actually end up in my bank account each month.

My CPA says a safe guess is that we will be in a $24% tax bracket. (married filing jointly)

Is it just federal and state taxes I need to account for in determining the best guess at my net?

"LTC hybrid plans? Lincoln, Nationwide, Brighthouse?","Hi,  I've been researching the new Hybrid LTC insurance policies. Both of my parents had LTC policies and both made use of them before they passed away. Having seen what a lifesaver these policies can be, I  want to get the same level of protection for my family. I'm in my early 50s, and in the US btw. With these hybrid policies, you pay a lump sum up front, then get a larger payout later when you need it for LTC costs.  I'm working with  my Financial advisor on this, and he first suggested Lincoln Moneyguard, but then I found this site: https://www.retirementliving.com/reviews/lincoln-financial-long-term-care-insurance  ... where every single post about Moneyguard is negative. I asked for a few more options so now I've got proposals from Brighthouse Smartcare, Nationwide Carematters II. Given that they seem to be very similar, I was hoping for some feedback or suggestions from the group..   Thanks

Retirement 'income' vs salary income.,"I'm trying to figure out how much of my 401k I'd need to withdraw per year after I retire to have an amount of 'take home pay' equivalent to my current situation.  These are the factors that can think of, but what else might I be missing?

Future situation...

* I'll have the 401k income itself -- taxed as regular income
* I'll have Social Security income -- taxed at a slightly lower rate
* I'll no longer have payroll deductions for the 401k contribution
* No FICA/Medicare/SocSec deductions from 401k withdrawals, right?

Retirees Spend a Lot of Time and Money to Buy Their ‘Forever Home.’ Then They Sell It.,"WSJ article from a few years ago:  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/retirees-spend-time-money-for-forever-home-sell-it-11636402781](https://www.wsj.com/articles/retirees-spend-time-money-for-forever-home-sell-it-11636402781) [[Archive.is link here if you don't have a WSJ subscription](https://archive.is/RCJIh)]

I thought it was an interesting read.  Over and over again, it seemed like people just weren't ""connecting"" in the places they were going to.  And in some cases, since they thought it was their 'forever home' they may have overspent a bit on price or fixing something up ... only to be selling it again a few years later and potentially losing some of that money.

Something to think about.

I don't have strong opinions one way or the other on the thesis of the note, just thought it was interesting to share.  As for my spouse and I, we had thought for a long time about places far away - even though I've moved cities multiple times in my adult life while she has not, and thus know how difficult it is to ""connect"" in a new city.  So this article made us start thinking about something closer to home but rural in the nearby mountains with land and everything on one story - so we're still somewhat close to all our friends from the big city if/when we want to connect and spend some time."
Finally Retiring After 38 Years in IT,"I put in my notice on January 2 and tomorrow is my last day.

Here's the thing...

I am inexplicably anxious.  I expected the actual ""I'm quitting"" conversation with my manager to be uncomfortable, but that is over and done.

Once that was over, I felt almost euphoric for about a week, but that has started to fade over the past few days.

It's not that I'm worried about anything in particular, I just find there is a free-floating anxiety creeping into my brain.  Is it just the magnitude of the life change?

Will it go away after tomorrow, or soon after?  This should be one of the happiest times of my life, but I can't shake these weird negative feelings.

  
Edit: thank you all for your encouraging words!  I am not even finished reading all of the posts, but I feel better already!    🙂"
6 months later and second chances,"Today, I am 59 1/2.  And six months ago... I. Was. Dead.   >!(well, dead adjacent)!<

*see*: [6 months and everything just changed](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/1517z7z/6_months_and_everything_just_changed/)

After my birthday heart attack, it was pretty clear to me that it would be a challenge to return to work or get anything meaningful completed before my scheduled retirement *AND* I really needed to focus on doing absolutely everything I could to regain whatever I could of my health.  I could either work or work on recovery…not both.  I needed to let go of work.  I went on short-term disability.

For the next three months, I was in cardiac rehab three days a week, taking short walks, napping, recovering, and sharing my thoughts with a therapist (*which I highly recommend!*).   I graduated from rehab and have spent the last three months going to the gym 5 or 6 days a week, continuing to recover, and getting stronger every day.   Just finding my way in this new non-working world.

Somewhere along the way I learned that a widow-maker heart attack has a survivability of 7-to-12% and it really flipped my circuit breaker.   I became motivated to do even better.  I looked around at the people in rehab recovering along with me and thought “WOW.  We aren’t just this sliver of survivors.  We are those within that sliver who *can* or *are willing* to go to rehab and try to get their best possible outcome”.   The part that actually hit me the worst was how this affected my friends.  For some of them, it was the worst days of their lives.  They weren’t coping well and their grieving was a lot for me to handle.  They were shellshocked and it was hard to see it in their faces.   Did I mention how good therapy is?

But here we are.

Did I really let work go?  No!  I tried though.  I checked email once or twice a week, discarded the garbage emails, noted the important business ones (*in case I came back*), and provided useful insights and references on the ones that mattered (*to me*) and then left it to my coworkers to run with that information or not.  But as the months have rolled by, “our” issues became “their” issues and I am embracing the disconnection process that leads toward retirement.  Going back to my old job (*full-time, part-time, or even as a consultant*) and the old stress at The Misery Factory^(TM) is no longer something I am willing to entertain.  I’ve been letting go more with each passing month.

And those pennies that didn’t matter anymore?... well, they kept finding their way to me.  Sick leave, vacation, short-term & long-term disability, and even a partial-year bonus all continued to arrive.  I struggle with feeling undeserving of my “earned benefits”.   But I’m not saying no to them!

But *finally*, I am done.   I no longer collect a paycheck but I’m somehow still an employee (*employee in name only*).  I will fix that next week.  I think they are having as much of an issue letting go of me as I had letting go of them.  But it’s beyond time to pull the plug and say “I’m retiring.  I quit.  Or terminate me.  Now, let’s talk about COBRA”.

Every day I wake up and marvel that I’m here again.  It’s not just another Sunday.  It’s SUNDAY!!!   Stormy?  Sunny?  Hot?  Cold?   It’s a glorious day and I’m embracing it fully!   I’m finding I’m not bored.  There’s always something to fill my day.  I am thrilled to be here (*again*).  Looking forward to stepping into whatever the future holds.  I’m ready.   Here.  We.  Go.

I know this is the retirement forum and this has been kinda off-topic.  I just wanted to pass along a six-month update.  Thanks for listening.

"No kids, no heirs...what's your plan for your assets and stuff?","We've got no kids and I'm not particularly close to my niece and nephew, having spent all of about 20 hours with the since they were born.

My partner and I do need to make a will because it's irresponsible not to. But I don't really know who to leave our assets and house to. Our friends are our age or older. Do we just bequeath everything to the local animal shelter? How can we avoid burdening someone with the
task of going through and getting rid of all of our stuff? I know everyone says to pare down but you still have furniture, clothes...STUFF. What are all you childfree people planning to do?"
Online banking recommendations for opening high yield savings account,"Update: Thank you for all the responses. Great information!  I spent time researching the info and decided to go with Ally. Not the highest APR available, but reading about the ease of use, great customer service, etc., made me feel comfortable. I'm so use to a brick and mortar bank/credit union, that I was hesitant about moving my money. I know it's the right thing to do and from the responses here, there are some great options. Again, thank you! 

&#x200B;

I am thinking of opening a high yield savings account at an online bank. The yields are so much better than what I can get locally. Then I start looking at the online customer reviews and get worried. I know most people leave a review when there's a problem, so I wanted to check here to see if anyone can share their online bank and experience. Thank you!"
Deliberately shrinking the footprint - our personal strategy,"Sorry for the length. I'm looking for reactions to our approach to downsizing and staying out of managed care.

We've watched a number of people our age dealing with parents who are forced to move out of a giant home they've lived in for forty years but can no longer manage, directly into assisted living and giving up essentially all their familiar belongings in the process - a huge emotional shock, often resisted tooth and nail.

My wife and I downsized 7 or 8 years ago, halving the size of our house. This enabled us to pay it off in five years, but also required us to lose a whole bunch of furniture and assorted ""stuff"". This is now our last house, single-story, small yard, room for one guest or three if we use the front room futon. It feels right-sized for now but we fully expect to be out of here in a decade or so.

Our next step will likely be a 2BR apartment, a short walk from a bus stop or train station, and close to shopping, restaurants, a park, other services. We'll have a car but the aim is to not have to use it much. Ground floor, with maintenance taken care of by someone else. This will require reducing furniture and stuff again by 50% at least. We want to be surrounded by a community of all ages and backgrounds. Nothing will go into storage. There we will stay as long as humanly possible.

Our ploy is to continually reduce our footprint to be always manageable by us, regardless of aging. We want to do this in a manner we control and choose, not clinging to anything out of sentimentality until it has to be wrested from us out of necessity.

If the time comes when we do have to (or one of us has to) go into a managed care facility, we want that to be as simple a transition as possible, with minimal sense of loss. In the end, we want to occupy as small a footprint as possible, leaving no burden for children to manage.

How are you dealing with similar thoughts? Do you disagree with this approach? Are you presently feeling a bind of having too much baggage you're carrying around? Have you made similar decisions?"

Worldwide retirement communities similar to The Villages?,"Me and my spouse really like the idea of The Villages in Florida where you get to own your own home and there’s a bunch of things to do all the time (soccer, pickleball, swimming, knitting) and everyone is eager to participate.  However, there are a few things that we don’t like.  In particular, we want to garden (and consume food that we grow) and we don’t think the soil/pesticides/bugs and the HOA would allow that in FL.  I myself have issues about buying land in a swamp but that’s not the point of this post.

The point of this post is to ask:  Does anyone know of similar communities where we don’t need to buy on swamp soil and where we can have a small modest garden?  We also want the community to have a ton of activities and a positive vibe where people want to join in on the activities.  

We are very open to searching world wide for such a community.  Warm weather is a must, of course (30 degrees F, or higher)."
Living off of just Capital Gains this year - any opportunities to think about?,"Our financial planner recommended living off of our cash and taxable investments before starting to draw down our IRAs, giving them more time to grow tax-free.  

My wife and I retired end of 2022, but there was significant earned income that slipped into 2023 - bonuses and vacation payouts, mostly.  Because of this, 2024 will be our first (and probably only) full year funded entirely by selling taxable stocks/funds from our brokerage account, resulting in capital gains instead of regular income tax.

I'm aware that the first $94,050 in capital gains income is tax-free (assuming no regular income), which is welcome.  Part of me is screaming inside at the fact that we won't be ""harvesting"" the 12% federal bracket this year, let alone the 10%, but I finally understand that you can't have both - if you take enough IRA income to fill the 12% bracket, then the tax-free capital gains is no longer available.

My question for anyone who has faced this same issue - are there any opportunities that I'm not aware of for someone living with only capital gains and no regular income tax?  Are there tax credits or special tax treatment for someone doing so?  I'm aware that our ACA subsidy takes into account both earned income tax and capital gains taxes, so there won't be any change to that.  But is there anything that only looks at earned income tax and favors someone with zero income?"
Should wife file early or wait until I start collecting?,"I would like your opinion. I don’t plan on collecting SS until my full retirement age which is a few years from now. After that, God willing, I plan on working until I’m 70.  My wife is at retirement age, 63 now.  She was mainly a stay at home mom so her benefits don’t amount to much.

My question is, if she files on hers now can she convert to spousal benefit when I start mine, or is she locked in on hers?"
Has anyone here bought an annuity through Fidelity? I am thinking about it.,"I am retiring in six months and am trying to figure out what to do with my ira and 401 I have with Fidelity. I do not have children and my goal is to have as much cash flow as possible versus keeping or passing on my net worth. I have 500K, and will get a 50K lump sum at retirement (good for emergencies). I should get at last 60K year (SS, 400K annuity, 100K other), and my expenses will be about 3200 month max. An annuity will give me peace of mind, I lost 1/3 of my stock portfolio in the 80s crash. I would love to hear folks thoughts on annuities.

Also if I do a 400K annuity, thus leaves the other 100K. I would need to draw a monthly income from it but have NO idea what to invest in!  Thanks for any responses.

Update: I am 64. S.S. ill be just over 30K, expenses including fun money is 3,300 month max but can go as low as 3,100, l have 50K in savings. annuity not looking like a good idea. I am currently in NVDA and FSPTX, I will keep some money in NVDA and looking at Fidelity dividend grown funds like FDGFX"
"Pension, bulk sum, or combination for retirement","Coming up on 60, and beginning to try to organize my retirement. I'm in pretty decent shape, I think....have one pension that starts when I turn 60 that is almost 50K, and another that is about 28K, and about 850K in IRA-type vehicles. I'm still working, and stilll enjoy it, but planning on retiring in about 3 years. I MAY have the opportunity to pick up a small third retirement, but I suspect I'd have to stretch work out beyond that (maybe 7 years, instead).  


My question is on my second retirement. I have the ability to take it as a pension (with my spouse getting a survivors' benefit of half if it), or take a lump sum (about 240K)...or a reduced pension, and a reduced payout.  


Assuming I would roll it over to a  401k....would there be any reason not to do this? My current plan is to use the retirement that starts when I turn 60 on getting everything done I can....carpet, new kitchen, roof at some point, pay off the car). And, other than making it easier to pay for health care insurance through my old employer (which might be a moot point if I stay long enough to get the third retirement), is there any reason to go the partial pension, partial payout?"
So...how much are you getting by on these days? (Only for those already retired.),"For this topic, I'm not asking anything about your income or draw-down rate. I'm only interested in what your annual expenditure is, as a thermometer for how much it takes to survive comfortably in retirement. How many are your household? If you can, also tell us what city or town you live in, and whether you consider it a LCOL, MCOL, or HCOL (low-, medium-, high-cost-of-living) location. Also relate whether you have some significant monthly loan payments you have to make, such as for a car or house.

As for us, it's just the two of us, my wife and me. We are living comfortably at $60k/year expense rate, in an Austin suburb (MCOL). We have no house or car payments.

Edit: First of all, thanks for the bounteous answers. Just spitballing bell curves, it feels like most fall in a clump between $40k and $75k per year, with tails down to $30k and up to $90k. But there are also some remarkable outliers at high end, ranging roughly $100-150k, and at low end, ranging down to $20k for the especially frugal. Circumstances are different for all."
Strategy help with allocation for soon to be retired,"I recently terminated my financial advisor based on the helpful feedback from this subreddit.  NOW, I need to educate myself more.  I am planning to retire next year, and wondering about when to start spending my Roth balance.  Many years ago, I converted 20% of my IRAs to a Roth.  I know it comes out tax free, but honestly - my income is going to be pretty stable (I hope) - we don't know what will happen in the future with taxes, right?  Should I just assume that they will increase, and hold onto the Roth until my later years??"
Looking into retirement… best option for retired military?,"Sooo…. Scenario is husband will be retiring 5-7 yrs.  He is over 55 now, and we are looking forward.  We are looking at new states that are military friendly mainly.  I am also looking at states that are business friendly as I will not be able to retire quite yet when he does as I’m a tad younger and would like to move my niche business (chimney sweep/tech) to where ever we land.

He will have his retirement, medical retirement (90%), and he retirement from working for the government as a DoD employee, plus all of our investments.  

In your opinion, lived your whole life or moved too, what state would/is good for us?  You can only get so much information on the web.  Property tax, personal property tax, sales and income tax.  And business tax interests us due to my business.

Also, we would like to stay north as neither of us care for excessive humidity.

We welcome all answers, but would love some answers for those who have been in our situation."
Journaling - During life and after,"Do you journal/ have a diary? Part of getting rid of years of stuff, I stumbled upon some of my older personal journals the other day. That writing, from the college years, was never about preserving memories but to help deal with all the stress.

After that period of my life I leafed through them maybe once. Should I revisit them? Now, in this time of my life, I wonder .. will I remember whatever is in there? Do I want to recall any of THAT? Will reading this alter my present memories that I have chosen to hold? Is the person in those pages still, me? Will I like them Or be angry or ?

And thinking further ... do I really want my kids or family to read any of my journals from over the years when they cleanup the remnants of my life? Do they even want to know and should they know? Maybe it would alter their views both good and bad? Also If I am alive, will it change our relationship ?

While I ponder this.. they rest on a shelf collecting dust with mementos that I have *chosen* to display for years."
Early Retirement planning with HR or just submitting resignation?,I have decided to retire early (62) and trying to decide if I should start this process with HR or just take all my vacations and then give 2 weeks notice.  I have a pension plan but I probably will not take it right away.  Can anyone tell me what is the best way to handle this.  What are the pros of going through the official retirement process?  Can I get COBRA if I resign?
"SOS - slower, older, and smarter (hopefully putting a smile on your face this fine Monday morning)","An Airbus 380 is on its way across the Atlantic. It just left the East Coast airspace.  The Airbus flies consistently at 800 km/h at 30,000 feet, when suddenly two F35s appear.

The pilots of the fighter jets slow down, fly alongside the Airbus and greet the pilot of the passenger plane by radio:   ""Airbus, boring flight isn’t it? Now have a look here!""

One of the F35 pilots performs a roll, accelerates, breaks through the sound barrier, rises rapidly to a dizzying height, and then swoops down almost to sea level in a breathtaking dive. He loops back next to the Airbus and asks:   ""Well, how was that?""

The Airbus pilot answers: ""Very impressive, but watch this!""

The jet pilot watches the Airbus, but nothing happens. It continues to fly straight, at the same speed.

After 10 minutes, the Airbus pilot radios, ""Well, how was that?

Confused, the F35 pilot asks, ""What did you do?""

The AirBus pilot laughs and says:   ""I got up, stretched my legs, walked to the back of the aircraft to use the washroom, then got a cup of coffee and a chocolate fudge pastry.""

The moral of the story is:  When you’re young, speed and adrenaline seems to be great. But as you get older and wiser, you learn that comfort and peace are more important.

Financial planners - fees and disclosure,"I am 65, semi-retired.

How Can I Find a Walkable Reitrement Community?,"I’m looking to relocate to a walkable town / small city in the US with cool summer and snowy winter climate. I would prefer to live in a 55+ building or community. I rather rent than own but but could also purchase if that is the only option. The problem is — I can’t find a community that is walkable. All the 55+ communities I’ve found are in suburbia. I’ve tried searching web sites for 55+ communities but there is no way to search for walkability. Does anyone know of a community or a tool I could use to search for one? TIA

EDIT TO SHARE RESOURCES SO FAR: 

Thank you every one for the great suggestions about walkable cities with cooler weather. I posted this query on several forums in Reddit and FB. Here is what I've found so far. 

[after55.com](https://after55.com)  is a site where you I enter a city and the type of housing I want (apartment) and the living type (active) and get a list of available buildings. If anyone knows of any other search tools that let you search for 55+ community rentals ONLY, in a specific city, please let me know.

So my plan is to use the [after55.com](https://after55.com) site and enter the names of any walkable cities I can find on the various ""top X place to retire"" / ""top X walkable city"" lists that I find using Google. I will start by limiting my search to cities located in (based on your recommendations so far)  New York, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Colorado. I know those walkable city lists are very limited so will probably eventually expand my search area by changing the map ""borders"" on the [after55.com](https://after55.com) site until I've looked at all the towns near the walkable cities that might have train service into the city.

For each candidate building, I will check (using Google Maps?) to see how close they are to places of interest to me: train stations, parks, airports, museums, theaters, hospitals, etc. I will also check other web sites and online forums to find out how good a fit the location might be for me (weather, health, safety, demographics, etc.)

Other resources I found:

[walkscore.com](https://walkscore.com)  (walkability scores)

Are dividends qualified or not? I need to know before I buy the stock.,"Now that I am retired in the USA, I am in much lower tax brackets (a sweet treat) and qualified dividends in particular will  be taxed at 0% up to $80k for us, which makes them very attractive. No tax is a great gift after working 40 years.  

 I need to know which stocks dividends are qualified and which are not. Everything I’m reading online says you get to find out whenever they send you your tax forms after the end of the year. But I need to know before I buy the stock.

When I look up the stocks on the various financial sites, it shows me that they have dividends, how much they are, and other info, but not whether they’re qualified or not.

Any advice?"
Beach condo. Does it still make sense financially?,"62 years old and single. . Won’t go into all of have saved but I have been smart,  but am in a tiz about a beach condo. I bought in 2015 with the thought that once I retire I can spend half my time there. In the meantime it has appreciated about 400k. Rental income is about net 30k a year. I planned to continue it as rental till I retire at 65 ish. But as I have gotten older it really has become a source of major stress for me. Dealing with renters, HOA nonsense, and of course dues have increased a lot, every hurricane puts me over the edge 
. . It doesn’t make top financial sense I know. There are times that I think I am stupid, that 600k (what I would have after paying off mortgage) invested well and I could live off dividends and be happy, maybe retire early. (I own other rentals) But times I just don’t know what would become of my dream, and feeling the sadness that our sweet place where I vacationed for years before I bought would be gone. But it doesn’t feel financially smart anymore. Sigh . Emotionally attached because I planned to retire half time there. Thoughts?"
Question on annuities. Hypothetical scenario,"55 Y.O looking to retire at 60

$600,000.00 in 401k
$300,000.00 in other savings and investments

$27600.00 per year in ss at 63 ($2300.00 month)

No mortgage, car payments or credit card debt

I've heard all of the horror stories about annuities, but am still unclear on the downsides other than you can't touch the money in case you need a large withdrawal and there are fees. What exactly are the fees and how/when are they paid?

I've looked at a couple Income Rider estimates that would pay $40,620.00 per year guaranteed for life regardless of market fluctuations which would be $3385 per month. This is assuming an annuity purchase of $400,000.00

If you add the ss and annuity monthly payments, that would be $5685.00 per month guaranteed for life. Not counting COLA increases. 

That would also still leave me with about $200,000.00 in the 401k and plus the $300,000.00 in savings/investments ( Probably a little less since I may need to supplement the annuity a little from 60-63 y.o.)

And really with no debt, I could probably live comfortably on $3000 - $4000 per month

The **humans versus retirement** podcast is great even though in the UK. Host is an advisor. Has Americans on it too. I found this interview with Dr Preston Cherry helpful for thinking about the transition [https://www.humansvsretirement.com/podcast/episode-16](https://www.humansvsretirement.com/podcast/episode-16) and this month that podcaster, Dan Haylett , was also on the podcast - the long view (by Morningstar) , and yes this podcast is also elsewhere on the wiki!

Calculator for managing MAGI and ACA subsidies?,"Nearing earlish retirement and will need to use ACA for a few years. We'd like to balance out using our cash reserves, taxable brokerage, and tax deferred assets hopefully leaving the Roth assets to grow further - it's a relatively smaller amount now so not really useful for the number of years we need to keep MAGI down. Does anyone know of a calculator that can broadly process these variables. I'm sure I can spreadsheet all of this but was curious if someone had already done the lifting. TYIA!

Investing suggestions for elderly parents,"**NOTE** This post was delay a bit in getting put up. My fault really. At this point, the die is already cast so to speak. We went with a 6/12/18/24 brokerage CD ladder with rates ranging from 4.8 down to 4.3. After taxes and inflation, we basically tread water for now.

I appreciate u/Mid_AM getting it up but - being fair - the underlying issue is now somewhat moot.

---


My wife and I manage the finances for her mother/father. They are 92 and in declining health. We're spending about $13,500 / month (minus $5K LTC insurance) on assisted living and memory care. Money, per se, is not the issue. Her parents are wealthy enough that there is no concern for running out of money.

I've got about $200K to invest today with another $50K of CD's maturing in April and October. I project that I won't need this money this year. I may need some next year. There are always unknowns too. We do have other reserves though if needed desperately.

My question is a sanity check on what to invest in. Her parent's are very conservative on their investments. They hate to see a loss. However, cognitive decline means that they won't necessarily see or understand what I do.

My thought is a CD ladder of maybe 6, 12, 18 and 24 months hoping to get around 5%. This seems conservative though and I'm not sure if if I should consider other options like equities. What would you suggest?

I'm very confident as an investor with my own investments and very tolerant of risk. I'm retired with 100% in equities. Volatility doesn't bother me. But, it might bother the other siblings."
Social Security Benefits and Working While Receiving,"I have a slightly oddball question that doesn't seem to fit anywhere. The text of the letter I just received from SSA says this about working while collecting:

""When you reach your full retirement age, you can work and earn as much as you want and still receive your full Social Security benefit payment.

Each year, we review the records for all Social Security recipients who work. If your latest year of earnings is one of your highest years, we refigure your benefit and pay you any increase due.""

I know that the benefit is based on my 35 highest earning years. I'm 66 and a half and reaching my full retirement age this month, but I intend to continue working until I'm 70 so I can collect my full benefit and keep increasing the monthly benefit, so that when I go (I'm a man, so this is pretty much guaranteed to happen) my wife can collect my full benefit, and it will be the maximum I could get.

My question is, this text is unqualified, as in, it does not state that if I start now my benefit at age 70 would be reduced just because I started collecting now. So if I start collecting now and continue to work and my salary is among my 35 highest years, which it will be, am I reducing my age 70 benefit because I start collecting now? It sounds like they recalculate it solely based on my salary without regard to whether I am currently collecting, but that seems weird. But if it's true I don't want to leave what would wind up being a pretty substantial amount of money on the table."
Question on Health Savings Account balance and using it when you get to Medicare,"Can it be used for Medigap costs?

Can it be used for Medicare advantage costs?

My wife and I become eligible later this year.  She has the HSA.  I don't but I have money my company set aside to use with their Medicare Advantange plan, but only on that.

Our community’s year in review,"Hello everyone at r/retirement and Happy New Year!

One thing not covered by recaps are the wiki. Our wiki  [https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/wiki/index/](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/wiki/index/)   earlier this year had little information and was a priority this summer.

It is still a work in progress.

Lots of interaction and conversation. This year there were 510,197 visitors , see below about our membership, and a combined 124,700 posts/comments. Contrast that with financialindependence , a community for early retirees and wannabes ;-)  , which had 4 million visitors,  2.2 million members, but only 319,000 posts/comments.

We loved this piece [My\_husband\_has\_become\_a\_new\_person\_since\_retirement](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/15d7sux/my_husband_has_become_a_new_person_since/) . And they checked in to say “Happy to report he is still much happier! He is more relaxed, in tune and has actually been sleeping in till 9am,something he was never able to do before. And has commented it has been such a great feeling not having to set his alarm. So the other shoe has not dropped thank heavens. It really shows how much stress he was under for so long. He enjoyed this Christmas even more as he was scheduled this year to be on call. He is happy to be looking forward to the next chapter and so am I. The anxiety of pulling the trigger on retirement is melting away day by day...”

Self-reinvention class in retirement: have you tried this?,"Happy new year, gang.  Forgive me if this topic was already posted and I missed it.

I just read this story in the *Atlantic* about self-reinvention classes for people who entered retirement and are trying to redefine their identities outside of work.  The classes referred to in the article are geared to type-A people whose identities were fully derived from their careers, but something like this could potentially benefit a lot of people including myself.  Have you tried this or seen anything like it in your area?  David also proposes starting a consulting company around this topic to start up support groups.  Anyone want to give that a whirl?  You would probably find several willing clients right here.

Funds in company 401(K) cannot be rolled over into Schwab IRA.,"Recently discussed consolidating my 401(K) into my IRA with my Schwab broker and was told the funds I hold are proprietary to my former employer and cannot be moved.

Suggestion was to speak to 401(K) administrator and have them simply liquidate holdings and transiently hold cash in the account and THEN roll it over. Since nothing is paid out to me directly, this supposedly won’t trigger any tax concerns.

Has anyone had a similar experience trying to rollover funds that simply can’t be transferred between accounts? How did you manage to move your money?"
"Retiring this year but son is hospice, need to chart a new path","This year I turn 66.5 in June. I will retire this year, and it just depends on which way I want to do it. The company I work for would like me to keep working there so this all makes for a nice exit from the workforce, at least as a FTE. But now there is a winkle. My son, a firefighter, has been fighting cancer for the past 4 years and 3 weeks ago his neck broke from a tumor there. He is terminal, any parent's nightmare. So I took leave from work and came to his town to be with him. He was in the hospital and now he's been moved to a hospice facility and this is where I have been living since. I sleep on an air mattress in his room most nights, trading off with his  wife. I have to stay here with him.I am now very unsure of my path. Being that I'm on leave from work, I filed for Ca family leave benefit.  Should I move forward with the SS benefits?,  I am not sure whether or not I will return to work when this is over. So maybe I am retired?  I am open to suggestions on how to approach retirement given these circumstances?This posting is first I've written about this situation. This group is about retirement and not how bad I feel so I'lll spare you all of that.. Thanks.

EDIT: Thank you all for the heartfelt replies. The takeaway I am getting is to not make decisions regarding retirement until later. That's sound advice.  


I always had the saying; ""Dont worry about the things you can do nothing about"" This rule has always served me well until this. I guess I just wanted to do something, anything to affect this situation.   


Another thing, I never fully understood it when people talked about what a cruel disease cancer is. Now I do understand. Previously I felt I understood this but I was wrong.  My writing style is very level headed just from practice. But I will tell you, this is pretty rough. "
Millennial on course to live with us in retirement - an update,"I just wanted to share an update to this post:  

[https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/16rgei8/our\_adult\_son\_may\_be\_living\_with\_us\_in\_retirement](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/16rgei8/our_adult_son_may_be_living_with_us_in_retirement)

Although it's only been 3 months, a lot has changed. I'll use ""J"" to refer to my son. First and foremost, our attitudes have changed a lot. I've let go of the past and my imagined future for J. I've reached out to help him more, and in turn he's been a lot more respectful. He doesn't smoke in front of me, and he turns off his phone's speaker when I'm in the same room. These are small things, but they meant a lot to me. 

J started a new job a few weeks ago managing a vape store. It's 40-60 hours a week, and he's enthusiastic about it. I know both of those can change, but we're all feeling positive right now. He had applied for and got accepted to a technical school to learn welding, but he decided not to enroll. That's fine; if he decides in 6 months that retail work sucks (it does), he can still enroll without having to reapply. 

I'm helping J learn how to budget. It's the first time he's been receptive to my help, and not defensive or angry. My wife and I decided the best way to deal with his 10k in credit card debt was to loan him 5k at 5% interest, and pay the other 5k ourselves. The cards have been cut up, and he's only using his ATM card now. We're going to start him on YNAB or some other Android-friendly budgeting tool next week. 

This is all very timely, because my wife and I just started a budget for the first time in over 20 years. I've made enough money that we haven't had to make many sacrifices, even after maxing out our retirement accounts. But now it's time to test the 9k monthly budget I've set for us when I retire in 2 years. 

I still think it's possible that J will be with us when I retire, but I think we're setting him on a path to manage his money better, and to seek out better opportunities. We tend to forget how ""new"" we all were at 25. Yesterday he asked for my help mailing a package. It's something that I take for granted as ""easy"", but it was new to me once too. 

My main goal for the next few years is to avoid framing his future through the lens of my own experiences. We aren't the same, and he may need more help than I did. That's okay. We'll all get there together.  "
It's my anniversary from a job. It has been 60 days.,"Today is my 60 day mark being retired. I am setting up future activities. I was both an engineer and accountant.
1. Will be taking a course at my local college on writing for publication. Me and a room of 19 yo liberal arts majors (Larry Crowne). I recently did an article for Tax Notes but feel I need to gain confidence in the choice of topics (always technology and tax incentives).
2. Joined the IEEE. I will be volunteering on their position committee on R&D and also AI. I am hoping that I can get assigned to write and promote a position paper to the membership.
3. Started going to the gym every other day. 

I am still missing the social contacts that I need, however.  Not sure how to get that?"
Bridging to retirement with Part Time work at same job,"Hey, good people of Reddit, 

 I thought I would share here an option I stumbled upon a few months ago. After 35 years in IT and 45 or so years of solid working and with two more years to get to my retirement “number”,  I desperately needed a break and was planning to take a 3 to 6 month leave of absence. It wasn’t the best decision financially but mentally I had gotten to that point and was willing to take the hit. I discussed it with my manager and he suggested considering part time. Since then I discovered that my company’s policy for part-time work is pretty great. I’ll work half the time, get half my salary, get vacation days prorated by half, but get full subsidization of healthcare, eligibility for raises, eligibility for stock Investments etc. 

I know I will need to set boundaries so it doesn’t try to consume 40 hours of my time, and I’m a little concerned that it might still feel like too much work, but financially it’s really going to help. 

I’ve talked to a few people who weren’t aware of/considering this option so thought I’d share it here in case it might be helpful. 

I start next month and can hardly wait."
I'm soon to be 65 and need help crossing the finish line,"The situation is I own a business with 2 partners. Their participation and contributions are under 50%. The motivation to gut it out each day and week is lacking. I am exhausted at end of week. I have wonderful employees and only have minor frustrations with them. My clients are large cooperation and government entities. The amount of administrative work involved grew immensely over past 5 years and I found with COVID, it is far more difficult to get others outside of my company to do their work. 
I have no debt, currently receive 2 small pensions, substantial savings and investment income. For retirement I have an annuity, whole life policy payout, 401K, IRA, etc. My retirement income would be above 400k. I live a modest lifestyle. 
The issue is just walking away from it all and calling it quits. I am sure some of you struggle with closing the door on work life. How do you do it? 
I have many hobbies and interests so boredom would not be an issue."
It's finally here--my last day of work. I feel like I stumbled over the finish line.,"After 31 years with my current employer, 39 total working years, I am retired as of today.  Whew--I work in IT, and this year was particularly stressful, with many high-pressure, large-scale projects to tackle.  I am going to take the advice I've seen in a number of discussions here in r/retirement and not do too much for a month or so while I de-stress and get back to feeling like a human being again.  I'll be visiting this sub often because I've found it to be a valuable source of good ideas and advice from those who have gone before me."
Ran into former coworkers several times this week,"Been an odd week as I keep running in to different groups of former coworkers this week.  Been really nice, I've missed the people, not the job.  But it was refreshing to realize I've moved on finally (retired 6 months).  Great to see everyone but great to walk on after, felt like I closed a book and opened another one today.  Will be nice to see people in passing.  So how long after retirement is that a normal feeling or is it at all?"
The Medicare Outpatient Observation Notice (MOON) is pretty terrifying!,"""Inpatient or outpatient hospital status affects your costs

Your hospital status—whether you're an inpatient or an outpatient—affects how much you pay for hospital services (like X-rays, drugs, and lab tests). Your hospital status may also affect whether Medicare will cover care you get in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) following your hospital stay **{this is what can clean out your wallet** \- u/squattylaheron}.

You're an inpatient starting when you're formally admitted to the hospital with a doctor's order. The day before you're discharged is your last inpatient day.

You're an outpatient if you're getting emergency department services, observation services, outpatient surgery, lab tests, or X-rays, or any other hospital services, and the doctor hasn't written an order to admit you to a hospital as an inpatient. In these cases, you're an outpatient even if you spend the night in the hospital.Observation services are hospital outpatient services you get while your doctor decides whether to admit you as an inpatient or discharge you. You can get observation services in the emergency department or another area of the hospital.

The decision for inpatient hospital admission is a complex medical decision based on your doctor’s judgment and your need for medically necessary hospital care. An inpatient admission is generally appropriate when you’re expected to need 2 or more midnights of medically necessary hospital care.

But, your doctor must order such admission and the hospital must formally admit you in order for you to become an inpatient.Each day you have to stay, you or your caregiver should always ask the hospital and/or your doctor, or a hospital social worker or patient advocate if you’re an inpatient or outpatient.Here are some common hospital situations and a description of how Medicare will pay. Remember, you pay your deductible:""

Things You did not plan for but wished you had.,"Hi,

Soon to be 64 and contemplating Retirement. Not sure exactly when. Told we could afford it now. We have no debt as cars, mortgage, CC are all paid. I think our income will be ok. I will be out with about the same as my current year salary, and in total even though my wife is a bit less our projected monthly income is about 4X our debt.  But i am still nervous as to what i may be missing. 

So for you who have been retired just recently and a few years, what am i missing? What did you see after you retired ed and thought ""wish i thought about that"". Could be anything at all...just curious...I have to be missing something...lol"
"After almost 41 years, I was told they want to “use my salary elsewhere”.","I was planning on leaving in April when my social security would take a $400 a month uptick. But as I was leaving for Christmas vacation I was called in “to catch up”. That’s when I was given the news that I needed to be out by mid January.
I’ve been trying to train a replacement but the people they hire quit soon after finding out the scope of responsibilities they’ll have. 
Anyway, I was hoping to have a couple of months to prepare and apply for social security, but I feel stunned and don’t know where to begin. I can wait till April to apply because my wife is still working (also for the company I’m leaving). If she didn’t still have to work there I’d think I might just go in with a box on January 2nd and clear out my stuff and leave.
Thanks for letting me vent."
Long Term Care - late baby boomer. Help me look into the future,"What effect will the aging and death of of baby boomers have have on long term care facilities?  It has been pretty well understood that baby boomer demographics have had a significant impact on the supply demand ( and price) or products thru history:  schools, colleges, homes, jobs, 50+ housing. The final of these would be long term care facilities. Being a late boomer I will hit 90 in 2052. Will all of these centers be looking for new inhabitants?"
"I need a retirement coach, not necessarily a financial adviser","I'm 55 and wife is 53. We both have 401k that we max out. I will get a pension when I retire. I can retire as early as 59, but the pension is significantly higher if I work until 65. But I am getting to the point where I don't know if I can last until 65. I feel I am on track to having a tidy nest egg whenever I choose to do so.  
  
My question is not really on when is it right to retire, but how I go about doing it? How did people figure out WHERE they would retire and WHAT they would do with their time? Honestly, I've never had much free time in my life, so I've never really figured out how to spend it. Are there retirement coaches out there who will help me figure out these more existential questions?"
Applying for part time jobs after retiring from corporate career,"I’m retiring in May 2024 after 35 years working in IT, the last 25 for a Fortune 500 company. Not a manager, but have worked with many in leadership and exec positions. 

Anyway, I’m gladly saying goodbye to the corporate rat race, and am looking at picking up part time work at our airport (it’s a Delta hub) or maybe an area college. I’m seeing that most positions I’d be interested in are posted on Indeed and Glassdoor and require a resume. No problem, except my experience is not really related.

Anyone have advice on how to approach applying for PT work after working in the corporate world??
Do employers care that much about past experience?"
Happy Holidays everyone!,"Please do share some of your decor with us :-)

First, I am sharing a photo of my little tree. It is always challenging as my cats like to climb, chew on the branches, sleep under but the other gets jealous, and play or eat the ornaments.

deposit in a Roth or traditional IRA for F61yo,"  
My wife (who does not work, used to but not in the past 10 years) has a traditional IRA in addition to a Roth IRA. We are going to deposit $7500 for 2023 into one of these accounts and wondered which one.  
I was thinking that a Roth IRA which she's had for over 5 years would be beneficial because of the ability to pull money out tax free along with no required monthly distributions. Not even sure RMD would be an issue in 10 years but something that I was thinking about.  
Or is it more beneficial to add to the traditional because of tax reasons for this year's taxes?  I'm sure there are other benefits to a traditional vs ROTH but I thought that most people were converting traditional to Roth with the perceived benefits.

Question regarding Tricare/Medicare costs once you hit 65,"For any military retirees who had to transition from Tricare Select/Prime to Tricare for Life when you hit 65, I understand that Tricare for Life is a supplemental insurance to Medicare Part B.

No more managing an increasingly bizarre group of technical folks (mostly engineers; as I am).  On the minus sign, no more daily interaction with the few close friends I have developed over the years.  I will still stay in contact, but the daily banter will be missed.   Projects come and projects go, but it is the folks you travel the journey with that make the travel worthwhile. Looking forward to spending time with my wife, kids and grandkids, traveling about, and learning some new skills in fields far removed from engineering."
The last years: what helped you feel motivated and push through?,"As the title states what things helped you push you through your last years of working?

-Obsessively planning the exit? 
-Trying to remember the things you enjoyed about your job and focusing on those?

I have a couple years to go and feel like I'm doing pretty well. But I have a friend who's REALLY struggling and simply can't come out yet. They have three years to go. Job is stressful. They feel like the annoying Boomer of the bunch though they try and get along with their peers who are now millennials and even zoomers.. The guard has clearly changed.

 Only advice they've gotten is that it will go fast, but for them it doesn't feel like it right now.

Any advice on the final stretch is a rough one?"
"Financial management thoughts, recent developments","My wife and I are both retired at 67. I'm deferring Social Security until 70 to maximize the monthly benefit; my wife is collecting hers because it makes sense to. Our lifetime, based on family, will be about 78-82. Our mix of set-aside funds is about 2/3 retirement instruments (other than SS), and 1/3 cash (plus a paid-for house). The cash is buffer for unexpected expenses and to live on for the next 3 years. Plus, the cash cannot crash in a volatile market, as election years can be. With the latest economic news, though, we're noticing that cash accounts are now offering about 5% interest guaranteed for the next year or so, and short-term CDs are even better, which is even better than some of our stock-based instruments have done in the last couple years. This feels like a good moment. How are you fiddling with things in this changing landscape to improve your lot?"
What do you do about complicated financial things when you are really old?,"I retired at age 57 last year. Nowadays I have fiduciary financial advisors to help me navigate all the complexities of being a person that has to file quarterly taxes and figure out how to best move the money in my various buckets around. I've never been a super financially oriented person so I'm grateful for the help, learning how it works for my own personal conditions. What happens when I'm really old? I can't imagine some of these people with memory loss issues or other problems living in old age homes remembering to do their quarterly taxes or other complicated things. I don't have children."
Mostly retired. Make sense to contribute to our Roth IRAs for 2023,"My husband (61) is 100% retired.  I'm (62) mostly there but did work part time for half the year so have earned income.  Is there any reason we absoluteely should (or should not) contribute to our Roth IRAs for this year?  It seems having that amount grow tax free going forward is a no brainer but want to be sure I am not missing something.

As background, our retirement funds are roughly 50/50 Roth/Traditional. I've already converted from TIRA to Roth as much as we can for 2023 without bumping into the next tax bracket and have money earmarked to pay the resulting taxes. We live off monthly withdrawals from the TIRA plus pension.  Money to make the contribution would come out of a money market currently paying 5.2%, but who knows how long rates will be up there.

Like I said, seems like a no brainer, but wanted to be sure I am not missing something.

Making plans for my third year of retirement,"So, I retired in February 2022, and soon fell into a happy period of laziness and inactivity.

A year later, I had a good chat with myself and told myself to buck up my ideas and do some interesting stuff. That worked a bit; I went out more, got back into bread-making and cooking from scratch; I addressed some major things I needed to fix around the home, some by doing stuff myself, some by throwing money at tradespeople (equally valid).

But another year has passed, and it's time to do more.

Although the New Year is only 2 weeks off and my birthday (65!) is only 3 weeks after that, I am still marking change by the anniversary of my retirement. 

So I'm giving myself until February to do a few things:

• Bring my guitar-playing up to speed, so I'm happy to play in front of people, again. This comes from a problem I had with my hand 3 years ago, that affected my grip. That problem has mostly gone now, but I got out of the habit of playing.

• Get in a state of mind to start hosting board-game sessions again. And after that, start attending other board-game sessions elsewhere. We had a long time inactive, due to lockdown. But others in my circles have been playing again for a year, now. It's been too long.

• As soon as the weather permits, start arranging the garden furniture in my newly restored back garden; repair and fill the veg troughs and make them ready for Spring planting.

• Sort out my conservatory, already mostly done, I just have to find storage places for a few large items, and cut up and dispose of a lot of cardboard boxes.

• Start thinking about sorting out the junk store that is my spare bedroom, and set myself a realistic, achievable target for that."
What’s your plan for dealing with poor returns in early retirement?,"I’ve talked myself into keeping a standard 60/40 portfolio in retirement, and one thing that keeps me up at night is the chart for 2000-2008. The first 3 years had negative returns, and the total return for that 9-year period was 7.5%. Not annual return, TOTAL return. I started a spreadsheet called “IRA Disaster Simulation”. The first sheet has 2008-2012, and the second has 2000-2008. I found that increasing stock exposure to 80/20 a year into the 2008 crash reduced the time needed to repair the portfolio by 2 years. So I have a plan for that kind of scenario. I would probably also return to work, if a crash like this happened in the first 3-5 years of retirement. I’d hate it, but I’d work until I restored my balance.

All my retirement planning to date has had neat assumptions about steady returns. They look great in a spreadsheet, but they don’t reflect reality. This exercise really opened my eyes and helped prepare me for the worst. I wish I could live on 2% returns and play it safe, but my plan needs 5% to work. That’s going to require taking risks."
Getting a loan when retired (HELOC). What are the hurdles?,"I was laid off at 58, 59 now.  I have accepted being retired.  I’m thinking of getting a HELOC.  Will I run into problems getting approved because I am retired?  I just want it for home emergencies (rebuild deck, replace driveway) and don’t want to use retirement funds (using increases income).  I have great credit, low debt, generate six figures from my investments and have $600k in equity on my home.  I appreciate any insight you may have."
Does it make sense to cash out my term 70 life ins policy?,"I (65f), divorced. My income is Social Security plus some side income from selling crafts. I have a partner of 10 yrs who is quite comfortable in their retirement funds and helps keep our standard of living up. We are currently renting but partner intends to buy a place shortly.  My parents lived into their mid eighties, my elder siblings are mid 70’s now.  

My retirement savings were wiped out by a Con Man fifteen years ago. It’s a complicated and traumatic story I don’t care to get into online. I was hospitalized several times and had multiple surgeries all from the trauma stress. I could no longer work and retired at 62.  

Suffice it to say I have only this term ins policy for assets. My adult son (28) is beneficiary. The opportunity to convert the policy occurred during this giant distressing mess and I missed it. 

I have recently learned of cash buyouts of term policies. Did a bit of research and it seems I could receive approximately $20-25k from the $100k policy. 

It seems likely someone would buy it based on my health history. I look bad on paper, lol. But I’m healed and healthy according to my Drs so I’m not likely to die by age 70, at which point this policy just poof disappears. I won’t be able to afford another policy. 

Should I cash out and take the $$? 
My dream is to pass on something real to my kid. I would prepay my cremation, and the rest could go to him now straight into their Roth IRA, but my preference and dream is to have a modest little cabin home on a five acre parcel near him which he would inherit. It’s doable with a 20k down payment in his area. 

Does it make sense to convert this term policy into cash at this point? It is important to me that I leave something to my kid besides tchotchkes and papers."
"55+ community (or regular community), rent, stay where I am?","I never realized I was going through a real midlife crisis until recently. I'm in my 50s (not yet 59 as the group requests but not too far off) and I just lost a parent. It's been mainly me and my parents, well, forever. I never married. So once my other parent passes I'll be entirely alone (I have siblings but they have a life). I'm very independent and have been alone most of my life but it's still daunting. I own a medium size house but on a big property (with lots of leaves, snow and mowing) that I take care of myself. I'm trying to make a plan for my future but I can't decide what to do. Very often I want to start over again. Go somewhere no one knows me and see what the second half of my life brings but that's scary. A new town? A new state? Not one person or place I know? But where I live the taxes are sky high and zero breaks or perks for those of us over 50 and beyond. I don't know if I'd like a 50+ community. I sometimes think i would (or should) so I'll have something to do. But it'd have to be single family homes as I like quiet and think sharing a wall (like a townhouse) might cause issues. I've never rented, only owned, and feel renting is a waste of money but then I think maybe that is what I should do since I'm getting older. I'd also like something in a nice area, 
nice views.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
"Is it sensible to use about half of our 401k (or stock, or some from both) to pay off our mortgage?","I’m currently 64, my wife is 59. We have about $600k in stock, about $700k in our 401k, and owe about $400k on our house. We live in Western Washington State, which is a pretty expensive place to live, but we don’t want to move. The interest on the home loan is low, about 3.25 % but the mortgage is about $2400. I’m not going to take SS until my wife retires, at which time we should get about 3.5k to 4k a month. Our reasoning is, if we could eliminate that $2400 from our outgo, or at least knock it down by half or so, our retirement might be more comfortable than if we didn’t spend the $400k to pay it off, and just paid the $2400 mortgage until, basically, death. Curious as to what the Reddit retirement community thinks…"
Are you eating to live or eating anything you want in retirement?,"Found a fascinating article about eating for longevity here:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/at-65-i-thought-i-could-eat-whatever-i-wanteduntil-i-woke-up-in-an-icu-7ca9906a?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/at-65-i-thought-i-could-eat-whatever-i-wanteduntil-i-woke-up-in-an-icu-7ca9906a?mod=home-page)

&#x200B;

This hit me hard because I just lost a younger BIL the other day.  He had a life-altering accident a few years ago and afterward sat on the couch eating whatever he wanted. Now he is no longer with us.  We've worked so hard for so long ... for a retirement that for many is simply a mirage.

""About a year ago, three days after I turned 65, I suffered a health emergency that landed me in the hospital for 10 days. My doctor and wife told me for years to lose weight and alter my diet, but the stubborn, Neolithic, 1950s guy inside my head told me I didn’t have a problem and could eat whatever I wanted, which I did.  
My time in the ICU got my attention, so I adopted a low-carb, low-cholesterol, low-fat, low-sugar diet. I lost more than 20 pounds. I feel better and have more energy; my vital signs have improved. Like many who have had a similar experience, I began to deeply explore the connection between longevity and diet now that I had become serious about living longer.""   The article continues ..."
Evolving - Wiki Wednesday Part 2 - 12.2023,"Hello community! In support of being a resource for retirement - today is the second edition of Wiki Wednesday.

Where do Americans live after 85? Look inside the homes of 11 seniors,"It’s one of the most critical questions facing aging Americans: Where to live as you get older, and may require more care?

Many might imagine living in a nursing home. But an analysis of census data by The Washington Post found less than 10 percent of 85-year-olds live in such a facility.

The analysis showed roughly half of the 5.9 million Americans age 85 and older are living with family, including spouses and adult children, while more than 40 percent live alone, including in independent living or assisted-living facilities. A quarter live in multigenerational households, with people of two or more generations under the same roof, and about 8 percent live in nursing homes or memory care facilities.

The Washington Post spoke with 11 people about where they chose to live as they age. Taken together, their situations mirror the census findings.

Anybody here doing the RV living thing? What have you learned from doing that?,"Some retired folks I know threw the switch to sell the house and buy and RV and live the mobile life. I also know some that did that for about five years and then gave that up and resettled in a permanent house. For those of you with direct experience, have you found it to be living the dream? What advantages does it afford, other than going where you want? What are the disadvantages, and how have you overcome them? Did you discover a blocker that made you give it up?"
Places to retire after leaving Seattle in the near future?,"I am 63 and have been living in Seattle for 30 yrs. I will be retiring in the next few years and don’t want to stay in a big city.  
  
Both of my kids live in Massachusetts and my entire family is on the east coast and want to be closer to them. My dilemma is  finding a place that works for my wife and I. Here is our criteria. 

1) Significantly cheaper than Seattle. We want to spend no more than $50Ok on a house. Everything is so expensive here.

2) Access to culture - We want  to be near culture. My wife is a sculptor and loves music and art. So ideally an artsy community.

3) Weather -  No hot summers. We like experiencing a change in seasons and Don’t mind winter and snow but no too much snow. No months of cloudy days in the winter.

4) Politics and community that align with ours.  Progressive politics- We are from Seattle. 

5) Health care - Access to good health care like hospitals and specialists is important.  We are both healthy now but in the event that this changes we don't want to be driving for hours to see someone.

6) Recreation opportunities.  - I like the outdoors and hike, bike, kayak, x country ski etc. 

7) Access to classes and learning opportunities.  Maybe near a college where classes are free for seniors.

8) Not a places with a huge tax burden.  Some states tax income, social security, pensions, etc. so monthly income is diminished.  I will be receiving a pension , as well as social security. Washington state has no income tax but we do pay almost 11% in sales tax, $1,000 a month property taxes, fees for everything, etc  
  
Does anyone have any ideas? I am originally from New England. I lived there 30 yrs and was thinking of the Berkshires or mid coast Maine but any locations that you think would meet this criteria would be appreciated."
"Newly retired at 62, starting to get my post work life organized, but not too organized.","Hello, I am glad to have found this thread. After working for 30 plus years in the finance industry, I'm finding retirement to be an interesting adjustment. I've always operated on a very regimented schedule and was looking forward to not being so regimented. I am finding that to be a difficult adjustment, has that been an issue with you and how did you handle it?

In my early life I worked in the food industry, always with a desire to get back to it. I have launched two separate ventures, a barbecue food truck and an Italian catering company. This is meant to be more for fun than a job as I am fortunate enough to not have to have them make money to support my retirement, but I'm finding myself quickly getting wrapped up and driven to make them successful.  

Any thoughts on how to stay busy without staying ""driven"" would be greatly appreciated. It's tough to be a type A with this much time on my hands."
Seeking your advice on near-retirement burnout + working part-time later in life,"Hi, all. Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Thanks to everyone who shares their experiences and knowledge here. This sub is very helpful as my wife and I plan for retirement.

I'm 57 and burned out professionally after a career in education and social science that included rewarding work, but also very long hours, slow-moving bureaucratic organizations, and the maddening culture of academia. My current job is ok (I have great colleagues and the work matters), but I'm no longer as motivated as I used to be and as a result, I feel like I'm churning out B's at work when I've always been the A+ leader of my teams. Complicating matters is that I'm also a musician, and I'm in the best, most rewarding creative phase of my life. Spending time creating and learning is where I'm most likely to find flow but I don't want to do this for a living.

Our current retirement plan -- a combo of our financial planner, my careful tracking of expenses, and my modeling scenarios in NewRetirement -- has me going half-time at my current job in summer '24 and doing that for two more years. (My wife likes her job and is fine working full-time for a few more years, then transitioning to part-time). An alternate scenario I'm modeling is going to a smaller level of consulting (it won't be hard to find work given my experience and networks) and teaching in summer '24, but doing it until I'm 65 (so, seven years of part-time work instead of two of half-time work).

My heart thinks that this is a good option -- that I'm not done using the research/teaching part of my brain and I might enjoy it again once I'm not mired in slow-moving organizations and if I can pick projects I enjoy, combined with teaching a couple classes a year. The logical part of me is hesitant to count on this, and thinks that suffering through two years of half-time work at my current job might be better than working an additional five years of fewer hours; staying in my current job is also the path of least resistance. The crux of it is being uncertain about my old love of research and teaching returning.

**My questions for you all**:

1. Can any of you share stories of being in a similar place, where you might still want a work-related challenge but are just burned out by organizations and people?
2. If so, did your love of what you used to do return after you left full-time work?

I searched the sub and couldn't find posts that really address this. Thanks for listening! I look forward to reading your thoughts."
While sleeping last night I figured out what my calling is,"I retired from the IRS  at the end of October. At the IRS I was tasked with auditing the R&D performed by large co's. The way I would do this was by interviewing a company's engineers. 

Engineers (I am one btw) always tell the truth. And they generally don't get a chance to tell anyone what they do. But the way I did interviews was more of a conversation than a law enforcement grilling. 

I loved for engineers to tell me their  life story. I liked to hear their take on  what happened both positive and negative, on the technologies they were playing with, and their feeling about it.

Now retired, I am looking to volunteer. Does anyone have a recommendation of where for a person like me?"
People already retired: how does your retirement compare with your parents’ or grandparents’?,"I’m just getting started with retirement at 67, but it’s pretty low key. Working a part time job for fun, something not very taxing and that gets me out of the house. Other than that, it’s little home projects, volunteering, and going to the gym or long walks. No big bucket list items, no extensive travel plans. On the other hand, my grandfather closed his owned business when he turned 65, sold his NYC brownstone, and took off on a 9 month world trip with his wife. When they returned, they settled in a single-wide in a cozy trailer park in El Cajon, CA. My own father dreaded retirement, and stayed on as university faculty until mandatory retirement age, and even after stayed on in the student advisor’s office pro bono, effectively not stopping until he was taken down by an aneurysm. What’s your family history like with retirement? Are you like your parents, or did you take a completely different path?"
Can annuitization be a no-lose proposition?,"Almost 71 year old retiree, career academic with all my retirement funds in TIAA.  I am seriously considering annuitizing the TIAA traditional part of my money, about 30% of the total (the rest is in index funds).  This amounts to a SPIA, I believe.

TIAA annuity payout rate for joint life/15 year guarantee is 8.84%, so that hypothetically annuitizing $1 million would yield annual income of $88k.  My TIAA traditional has an interest rate of 4.375%.  If I enter these numbers into an annuity payout calculator, the break even point appears to be about 15.5 years.  I understand this to mean that I, or my heirs, would be guaranteed to receive as much money from annuitization as I would have by  leaving the money to collect interest as it is now.  Obviously with the possibility of receiving more, as according to joint life expectancy tables there is a 75% chance of at least one of us living longer than 15 years.

I gather that annuities are not popular on this forum.  But, it appears to me that annuitizing this money is a can't lose proposition, as I am guaranteed to at least as much money as I would by just taking periodic payments.  Is my thinking here correct, or am I missing something fundamental?

I imagine some will point out that I can earn higher returns in equities, etc.  But this is the fixed income/bond equivalent part of my portfolio; it would stay low-risk.  Plus, there are constraints on how one can access TIAA traditional and it would be hard to invest this money in equities anyway.

Has anyone here tried RoadScholar trip packages?,"My wife and I are not big travelers at all, but are considering making a select few number of trips over the next couple of years while we are still young (age 66, ha!). We visited London once, and Paris once, and liked them both, but did not think those trips were worth the cost. We are not into restaurants or shows or shopping, but like outdoors, hiking, etc. I see that Roadscholars has some package deals that include mostly beautiful hikes in various parts of the world. Their European trips look good, but seem pricey - $10,000 for two not including air fare. I wonder if folks here have had good or bad experiences with this group. Also, am I just being a cheapskate, or does that sort of price for a two week trip seem a little high? (probably I am just stuck in 1980's price estimates, I suppose)"

Anyone have experience with Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs)?,"Not retired yet, 2 years away. My hubby (73) is retired, I’m 63. We have a 5 acre rural “homestead” with extensive flower & veggie gardens, chickens, ducks etc. it requires a lot of maintenance! 

We also take care of my mom who lives on the property. Luckily we’re relatively healthy, but seeing my mom and dad age (dad passed a few years ago), and struggle with taking care of their property for many years, we’ve agreed we won’t do that. Nor can we rely on his kids to take care of us (they live many states away). 

Considering our age difference, I’ve looked into continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). However, I’ve not known anyone who’s experienced them. Has anyone had personal experience or known someone who has? If so, what are the pros and cons? TIA!"
"Working part-time in retirement? What’s enough, what’s too much?","I know there are some people who will say if you’re working at all, you’re not retired. There are others (like me) who work a little because it’s mentally and physically healthier to be out in the world doing something interesting but not overtaxing. So, for those of you who are in a part-time job because you *want* to, not because you *have* to, what kind of hours are you pulling a week? Do you run into any scheduling hassles? How have you fit that into your day-to-day? Are you working a little too much, a little too little, or just about right? What would you change if you could?"
Best strategy for withdrawals of investments,"I recently retired with a pension. With my pension and my Social Security, I’m still going to be in a fairly high tax bracket. When I left my government job, I was allowed to roll my IAP 457 over to Voya without any fees. One time only. 

 I’m really concerned because every time I take any money out of that, I’m going to be taxed on it, increasing my tax bracket at the end if the year. 

This is all really new to me. I do have enough monthly income (at this point), so I do not need to take money out of it to survive every month. 

If anything comes up though, a home repair, a larger purchase, vacation, I am going to need to take money out of it. If I go into a nursing home, that is what’s going to have to pay for it for a while. What strategy does people use when they start taking money out of their investment and what is your thought process around it? We can’t take the money with us when we die, so it doesn’t really do us any good to just sit in there and grow and never use it. On the other hand, if an emergency comes up, we need that money to be there. I’m just wondering does people just take out the interest that they’ve made or the growth that we’ve made every year, or a regular amount every month? I know it’s probably different for everybody depending on what their financial situation is, but is there a general strategy on how to determine how to utilize that money?"
Worth contributing to a Roth in late 50s?,"I'm (f57) am considering opening Roth accounts for me and my husband (60).  I'm maxed out on my 401(k) and plan on being in a lower tax bracket when we retire.  We're not eligible for a traditional IRA, nor do we have any interest in doing any backdoor conversions.

This will be our first Roths.  I've looked into this topic a lot, but am unable to find out whether it's considered a good idea or not.  Husband wants to retire at 60, I'm thinking 65 for me only for health insurance coverage, plus I make a decent salary."
Any geezer gamers out there? Is gaming a retirement activity for you?,"Just curious how many other old folks are into gaming.  For me getting a steering wheel for my PC (for race sims) was one of my better retirement purchases; also play strategy games.

(I have to laugh when I read people in their 40's on various gaming forums say they're ""old"".)


Edit after 102 comments:  Wow, more aging gamers out there than I expected.  I just wanted to mention: if you have grandkids, running a family-and-friends-only Minecraft server is a lot of fun.  I got an old Dell Optiplex for $75, added an SSD, put it in my son's basement (he has fibre) and all eight of my grandkids love it.  I'm a retired software developer and using my rusting tech skill to make custom animals for the grandkids is fun and gives me cool grandpa cred with their friends."
"Sorting out options on where to retire, stay in home state or venture out...",Retiring soon and contemplating where to live. Born in NYC and have lived in NJ since I was 4 years old. Both parents passed so nothing keeping me in NJ. Strongly considering Florida in a new community about 10 miles inland. Need to pull the trigger soon as in the next 6 months. Living in my current home for 17 years and it has a lot of stairs and cold in the Winter. What made you decide?
Struggle deciding if I should retire at 61 from a highly compensated job,"Before I explain my situation, I understand that I am very fortunate. I do not take my situation for granted.

I have been with a company for over 30 years.  I have gone up through the company ladder executive positions.  I am now a COO and can be a CEO in two years.  I'm currently 60 years old.

My job has been stressful and it has wore on me.  Starting with the pandemic, that stress felt like it exploded.  Learning to run a business with remote workers (we were all on a large office), getting the business through the pandemic, and losing personal in person relationships.  

Throughout I have sought out counseling but also have continued to watch myself wear down.  I'll admit I'm seeing a little more energy as I get away from the pandemic.  I truly enjoy leading people and watching them grow.

As I noted, in two years I can be the CEO at age 62.  Compensation is very good and the opportunity to lead is still interesting.

But -- my parents died at 63 and 67.  My psychiatrist has told me I am too beat up and wants be to retire now.  I'm willing to do it in one more year at the soonest.

Financially I will be OK (obviously not as well as working).  But of course I see what the rewards would be to keep working. I'm also afraid of what I will be without work - even though I know I need time to figure out who I really am after so many years of feeling beat up.

Interested in thoughts from others who have struggled with the decision to retire earlier when stress has been a component or other things in life have come up.

universal life insurance policy review - surrender mom's policy?,"First I want to thank this community for helping me understand universal life insurance and questions to ask AIG regarding my mom's policy! We sent a letter asking for details, including multiple in-force illustration scenarios. They only sent back a 2 page letter stating some basic info. We wouldn't have thought to send a second request with a copy to the state commissioner, which we then received 3 scenarios back  (although AIG said that they had included it in the original response...) Anyway, I wouldn't have gotten this far on my own, so TY! [Please ELI5 universal life insurance and if I should be looking into it for my mom](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/15jhhaz/please_elif5_universal_life_insurance_and_if_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

My mom is ""technically"" 68, but in my original post I said she was 70 (that's another story) she's been paying $87/month for past 17 years. My grandfather lived until: 80 and my grandmother: 83. My mom has an active social life but has a couple health issues, and if she takes care of it, I could see her living until hopefully 80. Death benefit is: $100k.

1. **Continue as is at $87/month.** AIG said for September, **$48.45** was also paid from her cash value, so total for the month: **$135.45.** Under **Guaranteed Amounts**, the policy would lapse when she is 77, and **Current Non-Guaranteed Amounts** (I'm guessing this is where AIG would spike the monthly premium), it would lapse at 97. If she were to continue paying until 77, assuming the monthly premium stayed the same: 108 months x $87 = $9,396
2. **Pay lump sum of $16,000:** Guaranteed Amounts until 79, and Current Non-Guaranteed Amounts until 110.
3. **Pay from Cash Value and stop monthly payment:** Guaranteed Amounts until 74, and Current Non-Guaranteed Amounts until 85.

I don't know what these exactly mean, but under Planned Periodic Premium, it has:

* The Guideline Single Premium: $25,068.87.
* The Guideline Level Premium: $2,203.41 (annually)

I'm still leaning on surrendering the policy if I can convince my mom (she doesn't have much and this was her way of leaving something behind for her kids. I def don't need it), and invest the money in an IBond or T-Bill for her. There is a surrender charge if it occurs in the first 19 years, but should could potentially receive around $15k, and so far she's paid about $18k, and ""save"" another $9k (if she stops paying $87/month until 77).  Am I thinking about this correctly or is it worth considering to pay until 77 and then whatever the premiums increase is if it's affordable, until maybe 80 year old?

I'm unable to upload a picture, but some numbers from the in-force illustration if she continue to pay $87/month and death benefit is $100k:

|age|Guaranteed Amounts: accumulation value|Guaranteed Amounts: cash surrender|Current non-Guaranteed Amounts: accumulation value|Current non- Guaranteed Amounts: cash surrender value|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|68|15,937|15,371|17,130|16,564|
|69|15,591|15,308|18,357|18,074|
|70|15,076|15,076|19,611|19,611|
|71|14,371|14,371|20,885|20,885|

I will ask AIG (again), if she were to surrender, if any of it would be considered gains and be taxable. And what the cash value is invested in.

Ever wonder if your ETFs overlapping each other?,"I always wonder if my ETFs are diversified enough or rather if they have any overlapping holdings.  ETF Research Center site has a neat little tool that will allow you to determine if your ETFs are overlapping. [https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php](https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php)  It allows you to compare two ETFs to find overlap.  It'll tell you the number of overlapping holdings.  Which one they are and the % of the holdings of one that is in the other one.  I wish that there is one for mutual funds.  If you know of one, let us know!  Cheers.

Edit: Oh, btw, that site has other tools for ETFs as well.  "
A couple of things I learned after retiring,"If you plan on/need to earn money after retirement don't ever say the word ""retirement"", people won't pay you for anything. 
I thought every day would be Saturday- it's not, every day is Tuesdsy.
Yoga is my friend. I beat myself up pretty badly over the years, yoga and PT are keeping me alive.
I don't learn as fast as I did, but I still learn. I bought a Switch and am playing Zelda, photography, Photoshop, some AI, cooking, and lots of gardening."
YNAB software to get ready for retirement,"If you are wondering if you are financially ready to retire, this software is extremely helpful. You will learn where your money is spent. Where you can trim, where  you do great. Most people usually save a good chunk of money within the first couple months of using it. It definitely is what helped me get ready for retirement. I used it for two years approximately before I retired, and I was able to run reports and really analyze my financial situation."
How to answer the question about income?,"I am newly retired in the sense that 2023 will be the first full year of retirement with no job income.  I am not sure how to answer what my income is for application forms (credit cards, mortgage, etc.) .  I have social security and some minor retirement funds, but most of my ""income"" is capital gains on stock trades, and much of that is within IRAs (spouse, filing jointly).  When employed, I used to include salary and vesting stock, but what sources of income do I include when calculating the expected ""income""?  As a specific question, what about stock dividends that are reinvested?"
Keeping entire portfolio in one investment house?,"I have just retired. I want to move my investments from 3 different investment co (schwab, fidelity, vanguard, TSP) to just Vangard. The total $ is greater than the $250k that is insured by the US. 

Should I be worried about exceeding this?"
How to calculate amount for Roth Conversion,Hello. I would like to do a Roth conversion this year (first time). Is this as simple as withdrawing up to the amount that puts me at the top of the tax bracket I am in without the conversion? Thanks in advance.
I Will Inherit; Should I Leave an Inheritance,"I’ve read a lot of sentiment here about dying broke or that one’s children are doing well and can take care of themselves.

I’d like to add a wrinkle. My mother’s family left her and her brother (my uncle) each an inheritance. My mother has been a good steward of her inheritance and will leave an inheritance to both my brother and me. 

I feel an obligation to be a good caretaker of these funds and leave them to my son and his children. 

Am interested in the opinions of those on this board. TIA!"
"I’m tired of pounding the pavement, I think it’s almost time.","Your thoughts. Almost 61m, just had 2 stents put in, pretty good family longevity. I started collecting my pension at 53. 1700 a month with 50% going to my wife if I die. I’ve been beating the pavement for 38 years. Just made my last payment on my 2020 ram. No debt. 1000 a month rent. Just over 50k in 403b. Another minimal pension of 20k when I retire. Small savings account. Not a lavish lifestyle…no big spending habits…average guy. 
Hang on and work 1 more year. SSI says 1800 a month at 62 but I think I can hold and not take it right away.
My wife will continue to work to keep us insured for 5 more years until she’s 65. All comments good or bad appreciated. Thanks for your time"
I’m considering buying term life for my son,"My younger son was our problem child and we spent thousands bailing him out of his poor decisions and scrapes with the law. He is now married and has 3 kids. His wife doesn’t work although there is no reason why she can’t. He has a steady job that doesn’t pay a lot. My fear is that if he died, his family would be penniless and it would fall on us to help them as my DIL’s parents have nothing. He laughed at my question about life insurance because he thinks of course he won’t die. The mother of his oldest child died at age 27 in a car accident. So I’m thinking of buying term life of at least 500,000 to protect his family. Has anyone else been in this situation?"
The countdown to retirement begins! How did you deal with the short-timers disease?,"I (56f) told my boss my retirement date today. I'm giving him 18 months warning so he can find my replacement or work out a way for me to work seasonally or as a digital nomad. So excited - I know I'll have moments of panic leading up to it but I'll adjust. 
I read something the other day that you should retire TO something instead of retiring FROM a career. So I'm retiring TO a 130 year old summer house that I bought this year and can't wait to roll up my sleeves.
I just need to focus on work instead of daydreaming about remodeling a bathroom. Sigh."
Retirement calc app - clarification on extra income?,"I put my numbers into Calculator.ficalc.app with an annual withdrawal of $50K adjusted for inflation. I then added $30K SS income to start 10 years after retirement.

Does the analysis assume that I will continue living on $50k total ($30K SS +$20K withdrawal from portfolio) at the 10 year mark, or after 10 years does the calculation assume I am spending $80K (30K SS +50K withdrawal from portfolio)?"
"What do you cash in first, IRAs or non-IRAs?","What do you cash in first, IRAs or non-IRAs? We have a gap of 4-6 years between retirement and claiming SS. We need to draw from savings, should we cash the IRAs or the non-IRAs (mainly 401k's and money market accounts)? Or have I not given you enough information? We will have no other income. I'm just wondering if we cash our IRAs first or last. They are all traditional IRAs.

I'm thinking I should leave the IRAs growing for 20+ years, I'm just wondering what is the tax difference between the two. 

And has anyone thought how REALLY complicated this all is? "
"For those retiring before their spouses, do they act like they're jealous?","I plan on retiring from my career soon, and will work part-time in order to keep busy and avoid tapping into the 401K or SS yet since we don't have many bills to pay. We aren't rich, but certainly not poor either, so I want to retire before I get too old.  I get the sense that my wife seems a little jealous, however I'm 2.5 years older than her and I'm 65 so I can sign up for Medicare now. I want to be sympathetic to her, but I also don't want to feel guilty for pulling the trigger before her. I'm guessing this is common but I don't really know, anybody else?

This is a great article on navigating the transitions in life and particularly retiring,"Essentially this discusses the field and knowledge around what is called liminality. The word is derived from the Latin word threshold, going from one space or place to the next.  Liminality is a quality of being in between two places or stages, on the verge of transitioning to something new. There's a liminality to the brief moment between being asleep and being fully awake just like going from employed to non-employed, or working for decades to no longer working at something, particularly a career. It puts me off balance, even though I know it is the right thing for me at this time. There’s a sense that I have done enough, made enough, no need to prove anything to anyone else. However it’s very stabilizing with respect to defining who I am and what I am at this point. Although this article deals with career shifts,  wholly suits retirement. https://www.careershifters.org/expert-advice/the-liminal-phase"
Plow social security payments back into retirement account?,"My husband (66) has always been the primary breadwinner. He was laid off from his corporate job in 2004 and started his own consulting business. We've made it through, but there's never been extra money to put in his retirement account.  He's reached FRA an could file for SS, get the monthly payments and put those funds into his IRA. Our income tax would be lower, we may even get a refund. Last year our tax bill was $12k (we make estimated quarterly tax payments of approximately $3k).  We'd bulk up his retirement account and have more of a cushion after he stops working, probably 5 years from now. 

I know if he waits till he's 70, his SS would be almost 30% higher, but our circumstances are different from a retiree from a payroll job.  Ira contributions give you a 60% tax credit, payroll 401k plans are100% deductible."
Any good books to read on Estate Planning?,"My dad passed away a couple of years ago, and the entire process of probate, inheritance, beneficiaries was a mess. The emotional effects were obviously hard enough on my mom, but this compounded everything greatly.

Does anyone have any good books that I should read? I want my estate/probate experience for my children to be as smooth and convenient as possible.

----

From my experience, I have the following advice:

Consolidate all financial accounts, credit cards, etc. down to as few as possible. If you have a 401K here, an IRA there, etc. your family has to first figure out where these accounts are, and then engage in countless communications with them to get them to release the money.

Beneficiaries are your friend. Probate is your enemy. Any account with a beneficiary is able to skip probate and go directly to your heirs. You still need to spend an inordinate amount of time talking to the companies but it is better than dealing with it in court.

Consolidate your credit cards and make sure your heirs have the passwords to it. It's really convenient if you can just log in, pay off the credit card, and then close the account online, instead of having to inform them that the person died. It's brutal to have your heirs keep track of a half dozen credit cards or more.

I'm still not clear about what to do about the house. When my dad died the house was in his name, so it had to go to probate to be passed to my mom. I think it would be better to create a trust with a beneficiary to skip this part."
Lifestyle: how many TVs do you own and in which rooms?,"For some retirees, TV watching becomes more of a thing. For others, just the opposite. My wife and I have just one TV, in the family room, and we’ve been fairly firm about never having one in the bedroom, and there aren’t many shows we jointly watch. But that’s just us. So what about you? What’s the presence of TV in your daily retired life?

Edit: results are fascinating. It’s interesting that the answers cluster around either 0/1 or some number that is “a lot”. (There’s a trough of a few with 2 or 3.) Also interesting that the watching habits are either “hardly ever” and “on most of the time”. And there’s no correlation between watching habits and TV count!"
How to handle retirement security anxiety?,"I’m 54, self employed in a very physically demanding line of work.  I like my job, but there’s no telling how long I can do it for.  I’ve a little less than half what I need to retire on so I need to contribute 50k a year to investment accounts for ten years. Yikes.  That’s not an easy task. I work a lot to make this happen.  I take two weeks off a year but other than that it’s 50-60hrs a week.  I have my house and commercial space(both modest for my region)paid for so I’ll be ok probably, but I can’t help but be somewhat obsessed with hitting my contribution goals.   I’d rather enjoy my last years of work and be more relaxed and present.  Anyone else dealing with the same anxieties and been able to get past them?"
What is your thoughts on helping adult kids in these tough times?,"I'm curious to see how many help their adult children out financially and with what.  For instance, I help my youngest,  age 24 out with rent and a couple bills right now....It's a pretty big little chunk to my annual budget right now, but I'm not really affecting my bottom line really.    

Do you all keep a budget in your retirement?  and take like a percentage from you retirement savings (like some the 4% rule?)  I have been able to help out my kid and still stay within the 4% rule, so it shouldn't be an issue right?"
How do you keep your brain engaged in retirement?,"Since retiring I have kept busy with helping my daughter plan her wedding, which has now passed. Also started playing pickleball for regular exercise. And I am busy with a non profit helping them get some new things rolling.  
But, I found myself spending too much idle time playing silly games on my phone or watching TV. So I have started limiting those activities and have replaced them with podcasts that teach me something.  I particularly enjoy those that discuss how the brain works and ways to make the best use of your brain (and how to feed it)! I don't want to learn yet another computer software (did that so many times in my work days), but I do still want to grow. I am loving this opportunity to learn things I never had time for before!  
What are you doing to keep your brain from turning to mush?"

Spousal Benefit Calculation - Will SSA provide max payment?,"I am in the process of submitting application on the SSA web site for my wife to start collecting social security benefit at FRA in February 2024.

In reviewing the documentation available, it appears that SSA will look at my benefit when they calculate hers in 2024 as they have all of my information as part of the application progress. I have the application saved and have not submitted yet...just want to make sure I am not overlooking anything. Thanks for your help!"
"SMALL, fun, purchases for yourself upon retiring?","I'm not talking about buying an rv, or a second home. 

I'm wondering: What kind of SMALL purchases did you make for yourself, for fun, upon retiring?

-Electric bikes

-Some craft sets

-A more comprehensive gym membership

-New set of golf clubs

-Season theater tickets

-Tickets to local pro sports events

Above all things we really don't have time to utilize right now but believe we might have time for, and enjoy, in retirement. Making lists is kind of my thing and engaging my partner is helping him start, finally, to think of small things he looks forward to with retiring.

How do I find a tax advisor to guide me on IRA withdrawals and Roth conversions?,"I’m 65 and plan on retiring from full time employment in 26 months.

Long Term Care Insurance - Good Deal or Not?,"https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2023/11/the-unfulfilled-promises-of-the-long-term-care-insurance-industry.html?outputType=amp

Bob Clyatt's 95% rule... a way to lessen the chance of running out of money,"I am privileged to be the owner of an out-of-print book, which you can still find used out there. ""Work Less, Live More: The New Way to Retire Early"" by Bob Clyatt, copyright 2005 (ISBN 1-4133-0200-9). The meat of the book is pretty simple, and here it is:

Have a highly diversified portfolio, full of US stocks (large and small cap), International Developed, Emerging Market, Bonds (US and Foreign), REIT, and Cash. A Boglehead four-fund portfolio would probably be fine. Clyatt's example was half stocks & REIT, half bonds and cash. That's the starting point.

The key is that you can take 4% of portfolio value the first year as income, **then in subsequent years you also take 4% of the latest portfolio value as income, or 95% of what you spent the prior year, whichever is greater.** What does that mean?

It means that if the portfolio takes a major hit in any given year, the next year you compensate by taking a 5% reduction in spending. This gives the portfolio a partial rest, and allows it to heal over the course of the ensuing years. Note... if the market is down several years in a major bear market, you will be taking consecutive pay cuts, but that's in exchange for assuring portfolio longevity.  Then if the portfolio catches up in future years, you naturally give yourself a raise, because you will be able to spend 4% of an increased portfolio. 

The alternative is the conventional Bill Bengen 4% rule, where you give yourself inflation raises even if the portfolio is hitting the rocks. I think that way is not natural... if we get another 2008-2009, or even look at how badly stocks and bonds BOTH did in 2022, I think it's totally natural to want to curtail spending. The 95% Rule gives you a formal method to do that. And it's really easy. 

 Clyatt shows charts (p. 190-191 of the book) which show that this method preserved a portfolio through the worst 30-year period ever for retirees... 1965-1994... far better than the non-adaptive 4% Rule which for the 1965 start year ran out of money before 1994 if it was too conservative, if it was all bonds. Portfolios with more than 50% stocks were OK. The 25% stock portfolio drew down pretty hard. 

Clyatt's 95% Rule appears in some retirement planners, like [FIRECALC.COM](https://FIRECALC.COM), which is free."
What online pharmacies are you using? Do you have any impressions about how well they work for you?,"I'm not posting this to r/medicare because if you get medications at online pharmacies, it's usually because they're not covered under Medicare C or D.

Is there a reason you chose the one you use? Do you worry about where the drugs are made and whether there are contaminants? How's the shipment wait time? How much do you think you're saving by going this route? Do you use them for all your meds, or just some? So many questions...."
Ever have understood why so much money is needed,"Greetings.  

I have seen, for many years, comments like, need 1-2 million to have a 60k income stream etc. 

Why do people want to be 80 years old and have so much money ?

Have enough income to meet your retirement needs, budget, factor in inflation, emergency fund, pro-rate the retirement account, to an end of life date, and plan to die broke. 

You might find out you do not need so much.  Especially when the life expectancy is 77/82, and typically the last few years are not that great.

What is it like to not have a boss and not have coworkers,"It's not my work that taxes me, it's the interactions and ups and downs of working in a 600 person office. 

My boss and grandboss are great people but there is still the expectations of work, the meetings, the process, the disagreements. 

A 50% WFH schedule helped me make it through 2023 - I can't imagine showing up 5 days a week now.  The dread, the weight of each Sunday night as 60 Minutes ticks its clock of doom...

So as I look at retiring sometime between lunchtime today and Nov '24, I have to say the #1 thing I am looking forward to is just not having to run the gauntlet of work relationships and bosses and coworkers and smiling in the hallway.

Guidance on selecting a financial advisor,"We are approaching retirement.  I (60f) was laid off a couple of months ago and am finding it difficult to find another role and I’m finding it more difficult to think about going back to a corporate environment.  We’d like to see if I can retire now and how to use our savings to support this decision. 

My husband (61) is still working and carries our health insurance.   

We are looking for an advisor to assist with this transition and to help manage our investments moving forward.  Years ago, we met with an advisor that tried to sell us many high commission products and it turned us off from seeking help.  As a result, we simply maxed out our 401ks when we could and invested in various low cost mutual funds and some stocks.  We are very wary. 

We have about 1.9 million in retirement accounts, 500k in savings, a mortgage balance of 100k at 3.5% (equity of 550k).  We don’t carry any other debt and plan to downsize and eliminate the mortgage payment. 

Any advice on selecting a professional is greatly appreciated."
Government Pension Offset - Which monthly amount to use?,"I'll retire next year from a state government agency.   I know the spousal benefits are reduced by two-thirds of the government pension.

How much taxes do we budget for monthly retirement pensions?,"Both my husband and I will have pensions, in planning our budget for retirement how do I know how much to subtract for taxes?  Between the two pensions our monthly gross pay will be roughly $8,300 -$8,600 depending on the month that we retire.

Retiree Insurance as medicare Supplement?,"We have retiree insurance for one person costing $180 per month. We could, however, choose an ACA plan for much less based on our retirement income.

I’m finally fixing my IRA asset allocation,"I’m retiring in 2 years, and I’m a little upset with myself right now. I had a free consultation with Personal Capital about 5 years ago, which was great. They urged me to increase my stock allocation. But I ignored them, and kept my 25% stock / 75% cash mix going. Then, I really screwed things up in 2020. That January, I bumped stocks up to 40%. Then when the market crashed in March due to COVID, I panicked and sold, locking in a huge loss. I lost 2% in 2020 when the market returned 14%! And it’s pure luck that the 10 year returns were the same for cash and bonds through August 2023. This seems like a good time to finally buy bonds.

Long story short, my IRA returned 17% from 2019-2023, while my target portfolio (50/50 SPY/BND) returned 46%. To fix this, I’ve set up a year’s worth of automatic investments in my Vanguard account. This time next year, I’ll hit my target 50/50 allocation. I’ll keep it there (rebalancing annually) until they lower me into the grave. 

What allocation are folks using once they’re retired? I saw a video that made an important point: if my retirement will last 30 years, I’m still a long-term investor."
Pros and Cons of Joining a Gym in Retirement,"I have been a consistent exerciser for decades and have a whole house setup. I've acquired a fancy set of weights that ratchet up and down in weight, a plethora of old DVDs, an elliptical, a walking pad, yoga mat/blocks/straps and subscriptions to fitness streaming services. This worked during my employment years because I always had to fit exercise in either after work, or when working from home, in small segments at lunch. It got the job done for me but I can't say I loved it.

I'm retiring in January 2024 and am considering joining a gym. There's something in the idea of leaving the house every morning and knocking out a workout before I start my day that appeals to me. I love structure like that. There are two gyms close to me, and one of them would be covered under a Medicare Advantage plan I am considering (I haven't decided what to do on that yet since I have few months until I turn 65).

In any event, what do you all do? If you are a gym member, is it worth it?"

Lack of Diversity- my wife is South Asian ( i am white) but 95 percent are old whites - mainly from Canada and Usa. I have a international background and have been to over 60 countries and worked in 4.   our neighborhood in the Bay is united nations and I like it


Difficulty making deeper relationships - we see people and they are friendly but because of size - difficult to see same people. Women seem much friendlier than men (is that a senior thing) Pethaps its because i dont play golf and am not die hard football fan. i miss true friendships like i do with sone people who have known 30 plus years- I should add we live 6 months out of the year there

Weather - yes its desert hot in the summer - 110 plus from June to September. great winter weather though

Anyway these are my thoughts? We are more or less happy and not leaving-) An similar experiences"
"7am this morning. WOW, I forgot how bad that is.","So, I've been retired for 10 years now and had forgotten how horrible it is to get up, shower, shave and be out the door at 7am. Once again I have convinced myself that even contemplating part-time work is sheer lunacy. Hope you are all having a joyous RETIRED day. (Yes, we do travel and I get up and go early for that but this was the ""got to the office"" kind of getting up"".)"
Charitable Donations- what (if anything) are you donating now?,"Noob here- sorry if this is addressed elsewhere, and if so, please send links! But having recently retired, I’m curious what your strategy is for charitable giving (for those here who can afford to)? I’ve just learned about Donor-Advised Funds, which seems like the best way to maximize the tax benefits of this, as well as Qualified Charitable Distributions (which I just discovered as well). But beyond donating “what I can afford,” do you base your amount on a percentage of your annual income? And if so, does that include all sources, or only certain ones? Gross or Net? Any advice/suggestions are appreciated!"
Life & Retirement Are A Lot Like Football,"I tell friends Life is Like A Football Game
You get 4 qtrs of 15 years each that you should be able to count on
QTR1  (1st 15 yrs) = Just getting starteed seeing what life is all about and what your competition is (health, eco status etc)
QTR2 (2nd 15 yrs) =  Figuring some things out and have a lot of fun making long runs and passes on the opposition (opposite sex)
QTR3 (3rd 15 yrs) =  Settling in to the game plan, starting to milk the clock a little but feeling a little good about how the game is going if you’re lucky
QTR4 (4th 15 yrs) =  Trying to figure out how you are going to finish the game with enough points to win just as the clock goes to 00:00 (retirement age)
After 4 qtrs (60+yrs) you have to acknowledge how lucky you have been but now you must agree you are in sudden death overtime. It could all end any day

Your doctors are the referees, they determine the outcome of every play so if you have not assembled a good referee team, the odds of going out of bounds and not getting the right call can end the game prematurely. 

In sudden death, you have to exercise alot and stay in shape so you don’t get hurt. Injured players don’t last long and if you get hurt close to the end of the season you may not get another chance. 

LIFE IS GREAT IF YOU CAN MAKE IT TO RETIREMENT and in any terms, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL because some don’t get that chance so enjoy it and don’t worry about the little things"

What type of puzzles do you complete every day?,"Do you make a habit of doing puzzles or crosswords each day to keep your brain active? If so, I'm curious to know which types of puzzles you find enjoyable and how they contribute to keeping your mind engaged and alert.

Planning for retirement date that hopefully will be here in about a year. HR Question,"I'm hoping to call it quits in just over a year. This next year is going to be spent planning so that I'm ready for the big day. I know HR isn't always in your corner and I know that I don't have to give any notice at work, I know that I can just up and quit one day. I'm not that person and will probably give a 2-week notice.

That being said, I'm very curious about what HR might have to offer that I would pass up if I didn't announce to my workplace ""I'm retiring"". I know there's no retirement gift and division of this company is 100% telecommute so there are definitely won't be a party. 

I work for a large corporation and am wondering if anyone has worked with HR when they were planning on retiring and what type of services or advice they may have given. Is it worth telling my HR department I'm retiring or do I just quit?"
Factors to consider when making the decision when to begin withdrawing on a monthly pension.,"I have vested in a monthly pension through TCDRS (Texas County and District Retirement System).  In 9 years I will be age 60 and old enough to draw on it, $3137 monthly for my life.  BUT, if I wait 7 years, to age 67, and it will pay me $5,773 per month, for life.  These are definite numbers because TCDRS guarantees a 7% return and I calculated them on their estimate website at the data supports a 7% rate of return.     

I still plan to retire at age 60.  I have a 401K and I can spend that down over those same 7 years, depleting it entirely - so I can wait until age 67 to take my TCDRS, $5773.  I compared the break-even point for the payouts and I will be in my 75th year when the two payouts are equal -  meaning that the payout over 15 years starting at age 60, and the payout over 8 years starting at age 67, are about equal in my 75th year.  

QUESTION:  Assuming my health is good (and setting aside the chance of an early death and Social Security payouts), it would seem sorta foolish to take the age-60 payout - do you agree?  The 7% rate of return is really good for a fixed and guaranteed rate - is that correct?  What other factors or ideas should I consider?  (I made my situation easier by not discussing the survivor benefit options.  I actually plan to select 100% payout to my spouse-beneficiary at age 67, for her life -she is 6 years younger than I am and this reduces my monthly benefit).  "
Next Chapter advice needed for buying home,"Hi All :). Ohio - 64/f (single, live alone);  SS draw of $1,100mo, on Medicaid. Considering selling house with profit of 225-250k. Should I buy another house outright with full amount to not have house payment or should I consider living in a less expensive house and gift my children the remainder?  I have no other retirement or savings."
Best research for retirement? Looking to build my knowledge!,"Am enjoying this group... Seems like a lot of people in here are very helpful and very knowledgeable. My question is this, where do I go to get accurate? Timely research on retiring? I am 62 and thinking about when I might retire. I understand how social security works, and I do know the different amounts that I get based upon when I retire. Retire. What I don't understand completely is how the health insurance works, and it is really not easy to make sense on the insurance sites of what I might have to pay and what would be a good choice. Choice. I do recognize that I could pay someone to provide me with advice and a budget and do the entire workup, but it also seems like I should be able to do that myself. I guess my question here is does anyone have any sights or books that they have found to be particularly valuable to learn about planning for retirement? Thank you!

Edit: I am in the USA... sorry not to call that out!"
How can I find a nice 55+ continued care community?,"About me: Retired since 2017, 67 years old, single, child-free, no family nearby. I presently live in an affluent Coastal California mid-size city. My townhome is fully paid. I live a peaceful life, enjoy the perfect weather and gentle ocean breezes, and overall, things are good. However, I worry about my health and becoming unable to care for myself.

My goal is to find and move to my last home before I reach 70. Ideally, I would move to a retirement community that offers continued care. Initially, I will be able to live independently and later transition into assisted living without having to move again.

How would I go about finding this place? I have a relatively healthy budget and probably would sell some assets before making the move.

Note: I cannot tolerate extreme climates such as Florida or Arizona in the Summer, or Minnesota in the Winter. 

Thanks in advance."
Life after retirement ... let's discuss ... let's start with living longer,"I'm not sure if you remember [a poll that I put up about four weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/170pdqt/if_you_are_new_to_the_sub_or_in_the_planning/) ***.  The top request was for members of this sub to discuss about life after retirement*** (179 votes). The category is very broad. Thus I want to first start the discussion with longevity in retirement.

I was perusing YouTube and ran across again a 60 Minutes 2014 documentary, ""[Living into your 90s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqKfL3z5yM4).""  It was a fascinating study into a cohort, [The Leisure World Cohort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3074957/), a California retirement community in Laguna Hills, starting 1981.  The study follows the cohort throughout the years and study the participants with some into their 90s. Some of the results to me were surprising.  For example, they found that a glass or two of alcohol and/or two or three cups coffee a day are what the long lived participants have in common.  They found that older participants were a little overweight and outlived the participants who were underweight ...

**Thus, let's discuss if you are about to or recently retired, what are you doing to keep yourself in the best shape as possible? Are you doing anything to keep your mind sharp?  What are your hobbies that you have lined up or are undertaking?  Are you finding yourself so jam-packed with activities that you didn't have enough time in the day to do them?  In other words, how do you keep yourself active in retirement?**

I'll start with my FiL.  He is 90. He still drives (ugh!), but only to the stores and back. He would get up early about 5-6am. He goes out and takes his chickens, ducks, cats, and a pond full of 20 years old kois (living within city limit believe it or not ... not deed-restricted ... thank goodness!). I jokingly told him that all he needs now is a cow and a goat to complete his collection.  He then takes care of his gardens until noon (or when it gets too hot), coming in from time to time to check on my MiL.  He eats his lunch and takes a power nap for an hour.  He would go back out and fixes things until dusk and goes in to shower and dinner.  He takes another power nap and tend to the chores inside and tend to his wife until 10pm. I often heard him said that he has so much to do every day! He has his full faculties and mental capacity!

As for me, at 59, I have begun to seriously start to pay attention my health and try to get it back in checked after my numbers went towards the unhealthy marks.  For the past three years, I power walked. I watch what I eat (well my wife made sure that I watch what I eat).  I was able to bring all but my A1C within the proper level (cholesterol, BP, etc.., low dosage medication aided).  I still have about four points to get A1C back to normal. I'm starting to play pickleball with my sons and the open play at the local gym, but the pain afterwards!  My objective is to get back where I was health-wise without medication by the time I exit stage left in 62 months.  Outside of that, I have begun to collect stuffs and tools for my hobbies such as painting, model building, photography, wood-working, playing guitar, growing bonzais, traveling, etc ..., tossing in playing with the grand kids, volunteering with the boyscout, tutoring, etc.

**Let's discuss what you are doing for or during retirement or any tips and tricks for others who follow your footsteps.**

"I am retired with No Bucket List, anyone else?","**I want to acknowlege that this may sound self-indulgent and annoy anyone who is struggling right now.** I am not and I am thankful, even though maybe going through a rough patch today. The gift of time is not guaranteed and it is uncomfortable to squander it.

* I have been filling my time with the usual activities: exercise, socializing, volunteer work, family, chores and hobbies. Sometimes it is fun, sometimes blah, sometimes I am depressed and lonely - a bit of everything - I can't legitimately complain. Just drifting with pretty good health and OK finances - very lucky. **Can I make a whole life out of being glad to be not working?**
* I will have no grandkids and have **no real passion for anything** \- I could take or leave most of it. Ocasionally something touches me emotionally, but not anything I can act on - I think and reflect on it. Anyway, I am not emotionally dead, maybe a bit skittish and shy.
* **So: No Bucket List, no desire to travel or make or own more stuff or run a marathon (no desire for competitive stuff), nobody to impress. I am not rich enough to start or fund a foundation for some good cause and don't want to return to the cruelty of the workforce.  It seems like a Bucket List is what people have that keeps them going!**
* Has anyone else dealt with this? Therapists have nothing for us at this age - I tried counseling. There is no psychology for functional old people who want a meaningful life and find it elusive. I have a church I attend, but it isn't one of those know-it-all churches and I would not want one."
I just moved. I didn't think it would be so exhausting.,"In the past on this forum I asked for ideas on where to move. A couple of my thoughts were Texas, Florida or Alabama. Well, my wife and I did move. Across town less than a mile away. (There's no place like home) We downsized and got off the hillside we were living on. Downsizing was difficult especially for my wife. There were truckloads of stuff that went to the Goodwill and Salvation Army. Even though it was a short distance, it was still exhausting. I think this is our last house. I'm 68 now. I don't think I want to try this again. I would advise anyone thinking about retirement to get into the house you will spend the rest of your life in.

I had scanned all of my documents And we met and had a nice discussion but the cost quoted was like 3x as much as in Texas - $ 5k.

Should I “retire” at 62 with the following plan?,"Just turned 59 and earn 80k/yr. My wife is 52 and makes 50k/yr. 

Our only debt is 70k on our 1200 sq ft house at 2.5%. Would like to retire at 62. My 401k will most likely have 300k in it by then. 

Thinking about drawing down the entire 401k in the 8 years until I reach 70 (along with some p/t work probably making $20k/yr). 

At 70 take max social security (approx $4400/mo) and wife take hers at 63 at about $1600/mo.

Combined that makes $6000/mo which should be fine for us at that age. We live in southern Indiana where prices on everything is pretty reasonable.

Does any of this seem like a bad idea?"

What should I do with this annuity in retirement?,"I have been working for my non-profit employer for 33 years. For the last 31 I've been contributing to my 403b, now at Fidelity.  When I first started in the retirement plan, one of the offerings was an annuity through TIAA-CREF.  After several years my company stopped offering TIAA-CREF as an option, so I stopped contributing to the annuity.  But it kept growing and now is worth about $42k.  I haven't put a dime into it in probably 20 years.  Right now it spins out $162/month which just goes to principal.

I plan to retire in 4 years at 67.  What do I do with this annuity as part of my retirement plan?"

"Hello, wife and I about to pull the ripcord on retirement at 61-60","Hello folks. Wife and I at that age we're planning to retire. Although we're pretty simple and don't live fancy, we have both worked professionally for decades and have 401k's about $1m each, we have joint savings of about $0.9m and assorted IRA's like Roth and conventional. She has a pension from a past employer she's eligible for. I used to do financial planning and have figured out we should have enough that Fidelity when using their model and guidance said we'd die with about the same funds as we have now even with pessimistic return scenario. So we're lucky in that estimation. Yes, sounds good, but I'm still kinda on edge. Our kids are in college and we had saved with 529's for them, so they are not restraining us although we continue to support them.  She is earning very good money but is sick of corporate stuff. But its hard to walk away from over 6 figures and benefits.

I'm so used to the work/accumulation phase of life and being somewhat frugal this will be a major mind warp to retire. Luckily my career has evolved to a work from home self-guided business and has wound down to being only partially engaged at this point, but I can find some new clients pretty easily when I want to. Right now after losing some clients I got gung-ho into renovation at our house which needed it when we moved in & I had promised wife we'd do it.

Anyway, we have never been Europe or outside of N. America but she is crazy ready to. So that's on the agenda. We will likely keep our home as we love the location. Its big enough we could rent a room out, but not sure about that hassle. Perhaps the kids will need a shelter as they spread their wings.

I have figured out historical spend per year and that seems like a reasonable assumption as w/o kids some things less, but we will travel more. We only have a house note, everything else is paid for and we are basically frugal minded cooking 95% of our meals and we love thrift shopping, etc. That part is easy to figure. **The hard part is when to take SS and when to start her pension.** I'm thinking of having start pension after she quits, not waiting as it will last her lifetime and between that and my part time company stuff, or saved money and SS we should be fine. But I guess I'm just money conservative!

I should add that while we are both reasonable fit and enjoy winter sports and camping, I've had a history of cancer and while that seems to be behind me although the variety does have a tendency to come back. I'm approaching 10 years from last identifiable disease (thank you medical science!), however because of this uncertainty I'm taking SS as soon as I am eligible!

I know I have only slightly mentioned our ""to do"" list and fun things, but its that initial jumping out of the ""work"" plane and actually retiring is a major thing for me at least, and appreciate any and all input.

I get long winded but questions are :

Agree wife should take pension at 60?

Are you continuing medication after retirement?,"For those who are taking medication for issues like depression, anxiety, or ADHD, do you plan to continue after going in to retirement?

What is your plan for vehicles after retirement?,"Just for a fun post. I am not looking for advice.

What is your plan for vehicles/transit after or during retirement?  Will you get new vehicle(s) right before you retire or will you continue with your current car and run/fix it until it's time to let it go?  How often will you change out for a new (used) car?  When will you stop driving? This tends to be a touchy subject for older people.  My dad was 87 and was insisting that he should be driving still no matter what we said.  A couple of year after my mom passed away, one day, he just handed over his keys and told us that he was done driving!

Currently, I drive 2006 Lexus SC430 while the missus drives her 2010 VW Jetta. We have a 2017 Toyota Sienna van that we use to go long distance with and we went places with it (ie. visiting our oldest son in VA, friends and families in other states, national parks, etc.).  I still change the easy stuffs like filters, battery, light bulbs, etc. In my younger days, I fixed my own car.  As I grow older, I outsourced it to the local, trusted mechanics for the heavier lifting stuffs like timing belts, brakes (yeah ... I stopped trusting myself a little while ago), etc.

My plan is to replace my wife's car with a new one within the next two years while I still work. I will replace my 2006 right before I retire in five years.  I will keep the cars for about 6 years (64-70ish) before replace them one more time (71-77ish).  Being older, I figure that we will need more reliable cars than to worry about them breaking down.  After which we will reduce to one new car until which time we give up the keys (82ish).  Then, it'll be the flying Ubber, Lift, or the latest teletransport transit at the time.

Edit: This seems very obvious, but this is something that some people don't figure into their retirement calculation. A new $40k car in ten years will cost about $53.7k (with 3% average inflation factored in).    "

Help me to decide if it’s time for me to retire or not,"I’m 59.  My husband is 65 and semi-retired.  

Pro’s: 1. I’m soooo tired, 2. I need more time to exercise and stay healthy, 3. We definitely have enough to live on, 4. I’d like to spend more time with my husband and dogs.  

Con’s: 1. I get much of my validation from my career, 2. I kind of have my dream job (despite it being hard work), 3. I’m concerned that I would be constantly thinking about the high earning years I’m wasting in terms of income.

Has anyone been in my boat, more or less?  Just looking for some words of wisdom to help me decide."
Do you still have something to prove? To whom?,"I am highly motivated in retirement (I have been retired for less than a year) and am never bored.  I study and exercise every day.  I enjoy these activities, but also I want to prove to myself that all the people who thought less of me (and there were many) were wrong, and to make my mentors and those who encouraged me, proud.  In a way it is my last chance to reach for excellence.  It works for me.  I can think of my father, for example, and I pedal a lot harder and longer on the bike.  Or I can think of that time 50 years ago when I did something I am ashamed of—another 30 miles fly by."
Medicare Suppliment Plans - where to find unbiased information,"Medicare Suppliment plans - where do I look for unbiased information

I want to switch from insurance though a job to a Medicare Suppliment plan but I am not sure where to look for unbiased information so I can determine what is best for me. I know this is big business and don't want to end up with something I regret. I need choices but I am not sure where to start.

I am 67 and healthy but one never knows so I would prefer great coverage just in case! I am not super concerned about getting it cheap, I want choices. I worry about being forced into choosing from a very limited number of physicians."
How do you know when to retire and where do I start planning?,"I am a single female, age 64 (65 in July).  I have been working since age 14. I just got laid off from my job and even tho I was not planning to retire now, I’m thinking maybe I should. My career has been very stressful and I’ve been ignoring various health issues for a while. Additionally, I have been struggling with depression and other mental health issues for some time, in large part due to the demands of my career. 

I have always been told to wait until age 67 in order to get full social security, but to he honest, I’m just over it.  I want to stick it out because I’m afraid of running out of money and I have no family. But I’m just so tired of the baloney. 

I have a small pension coming to me (about $700 per mo), a decent but not amazing 401(k) and whatever I get from SS. My current home, which I hate is not even close to paid off and I do not want to retire in the state I currently live (Alaska)  but have no idea where I want to go because I was expecting more time to plan.  I don’t have any real debt except for my house. 

Right now I feel overwhelmed and don’t know where to start to see if I can even do this.  I don’t want to waste money on financial planners who will try to sell me investments; my mother did that after my fathers death and lost a lot of money as these guys just churned her accounts into nothing. 

Can anyone recommend a place to start? Maybe a good book or a website that will help me understand social security and Medicare and retirement in general?  And maybe help me do some planning. 

I would also like advice about downsizing. I have a lot of stuff that I’d like to sell in order to downsize and probably move out of state. But Craig’s list and garage sales are not an option since there is a lot of crime here and I feel vulnerable. Are there services that will just sell all your crap for you? Furniture, books, etc. Because I really want to simplify. 

Is there anything else I should do? I have health  insurance but it is super expensive - almost $700 per mo. I don’t understand Obamacare either and so would like to find some coaching there too. I need good insurance because I want to deal with my medical concerns, but maybe I should wait until I get Medicare? I don’t know. 

As you can see, I am not even remotely prepared for this and have no idea what I’m doing. 

Any advice is appreciated.  Please be kind. I know that I’m pretty ignorant, but I really thought I had a few years left to plan this."
Part II - anticipation becomes reality - downsized to retirement,"I’ve never posted on a personal issue before. I’d like to thank all of those who provided the “group therapy” on my angst earlier this week.  I was offered the package in the RIF
on Monday.  I’ll be full time until December 31.  And then pay for a generous/reasonable # of months afterwards.    I will sign up for Medicare asap.  Should be financially able to push SS start to close to 70.  
The comments here really helped me to consider a. Unemployment compensation
b. Consult with attorney 
c.  I don’t need to prove anything anymore

The feedback has been generous and genuine.  And really helped me to get over the angst and excited about the next chapter.  

Many thanks to all who weighed in!"
What are some things/hobbies you do in retirement that also makes some extra money?,So I currently ref hockey for some extra income and it’s something I really enjoy as it’s fun and good exercise. And I intend to continue to do it when I retire as well to get me out of the house and have some fun and make some extra income to supplement my retirement. BUT I also realize that it takes a toll on your body and I don’t know how long into retirement i would be able to continue to do it. So what are some other fun hobbies that you do that fills up some time that’s fun and earns a little extra money to play with? I’m planning my retirement as if I have no additional income (including SS because I don’t know how much if any I’ll get in social security) but it would hurt yo have some extra income streams just in case. Especially since I’d like to do a lot of travel as well when I retire. Hopefully I hit my character requirement for this post but what are some things that you guys do?

Managing MAGI tradeoffs: ACA subsidy v. Roth conversions,"The following post applies to U.S. pre-medicare taxpayers who need to buy health insurance.

Can anyone recommend some calculators, books, or websites to optimize modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) to balance between the ACA subsidy and Roth conversions?  The ACA subsidy increases with a lower MAGI, while Roth conversions add to MAGI but can lower lifetime tax liability.  I've been trying to work out the math on this in a spreadsheet and I have not been able to."
Spouse passed. Need help thinking through insurance options.,"Spouse passed unexpectedly a couple weeks ago. I am 61 and utterly lost about how to handle insurance. I have never worked and do not have employer options. 

Should I be applying for 2023 coverage through special enrollment period? I am unlikely to get any savings because we still had my spouse’s income while he was alive. 2023 is ending soon that I am tempted to just go without insurance and purchase for 2024 given the high costs.

Entering retirement and marital status/gender,"It feels like many retirement articles and posts are about married people. When you entered retirement (or if not already, while preparing for), what was your marital status?

Anticipating being downsized into retirement,"On my 65th birthday, my company, publicly traded company, announced (the less then stellar) Q3 results. And the downsizing.  Everyone learns who is affected tomorrow.  I’m likely to get a “package”.  I’ve never been without cash flow.  If I don’t get a downsized, it will be a slog going forward.  Financially, I should be comfortable
to step out, but will need to dial the spending back.  The not knowing is difficult. I think this will make the decision for me to retire easier, but it feels like I didn’t go out on top?  Anyone have experience with this? 

I should add that my husband is 75 and “thinks” he would like for me to retire. Haha! He might not when/if it becomes reality!

Edit: thank you for this support and the good ideas. Part of the issue is I can’t talk to anyone in the company.  It is all conjecture at this point on who is leaving and who is not.  
I am set on healthcare. Medicare as of last week and Tricare.  Thanks to my husband’s military service. 
It is not going to get easier at work in the near future and I think as some have suggested this is the push I probably need.

"Retiring in two weeks, I'm excited but also nervous. Need advice.","Question for retired folks: how did your first year of retirement go?  What did you do right/wrong, and what would you do differently if you could relive it?

My background: My retirement date is Fri Nov 17, only two weeks away. The light at the end of the tunnel is fast approaching and growing bright.  My financial advisor said I'm good to go, all my debt is paid off, plenty of savings in tax-deferred and regular brokerage accounts, no concerns there. 

I'm 59M and relatively healthy, I have a list of hobbies and interests ready to pursue.  My partner still works full time and isn't planning to retire for another 10 years, so I'll need to entertain myself or find other retired folks to hang with (most of my friends are still working).

It's so exciting, and I feel lucky and privileged to be able to do it.  I still can't believe it's happening TBH.   

And yet, I have a sense of dread as well. I'm wrapping up a 35 year career that I mostly liked, sometimes loved, and sometimes despised.  These last 10 years were the best, I managed a fantastic team of software engineers in a small business.   I'm good friends with the business leaders and my team, they are my work family.  

So I guess I'm feeling a sense of loss.  Maybe a bit of an identity crisis.   When I'm no longer a software engineering manager, who am I?  I won't miss the actual work, just the people, the challenge, and the teamwork.  I'm a bit worried about getting bored in retirement, setting my own schedule, staying disciplined, feeling relevant.  Being a couch potato is not my style.

Any tips or advice welcome."
Can we only take so much out of our 401k a year?,"Please explain. My husband is a recently retired postal employee and we are confused if we can take out large amount out  of 401k and not lose his pension?  He says he can only make $22,000 a year now that he is retired and will be penalized if he earns more than that.   So if we take out say 25,000 or above from 401k does that count against the 22,000 he is permitted to make extra per year? My husband retired at end of May this year and we would like to take money out of his 401k so that we can have a good amount sitting in our checking account. I should also point out my husband turns 61 this month."

We don’t want to battle snow because we are older, but we need more sun. We want a very safe, friendly town, that is easy to navigate. We are middle class, so we can’t go to places like San Diego.  We are not fans of the southeast, it’s too humid. We would greatly appreciate hearing from those who have experience living around the country."
Advantage Plans - I just switched over and got slammed,"Hiya,  
  
I hate me sometimes. I thought I did the research, but with all ""this and that"" this year, I dropped the ball. The sales staff said everything was covered. But, I should have looked so much closer.

I am a Transplant patient, and we need, not want, need to go to our Transplant Centers for our testing, reviews, Clinic visits, et al. When I called my Transplant Center about the change, they about fainted. Especially with all the difficulties I have had with my journey, they said they need me close. They don't want to wait a couple of days for my blood tests, my chest x-rays, breathing tests, etc. 

  
Anyway, with my advantage plan, this is how things are now changed:

* things have to be approved by my PCP, major tests, and maybe bigger prescriptions
* all testing has to be done at my PCP local clinic, not Transplant Center, even my yearly tests
* I have to get a referral for my clinic visits from my PCP  


I used to get to go to one place, my Team's location, and everything was done there. Now, I have to go to maybe four places: my PCP, one of the two PCP testing centers, and my Team's location. 

Luckily, I think I fall under that Initial Enrollment Period. So on Monday, I will be burning up the phone, and finding a new Advantage Plan. 

Geez. So, if you have existing conditions, and you are connected to Centers, ask the questions I didn't ask.

"Prepare wills, health care proxies, POAs, etc.","If you haven’t done this yet, do it as part of your retirement planning!

You aren’t going to be alive and well forever. Yeah, I know thinking about this is a bummer.  You and your spouse/partner need to prepare. I won’t advocate seeing a lawyer vs. self-prepared documents, but I will tell you that an attorney will make sure that what is prepared is complete and will stand up legally. My wife was a lawyer, so you can guess which path we followed.  WARNING: I AM NOT A LAWYER, BUT I DID LIVE WITH ONE FOR 41 YEARS.

You need a Will. This will state what the disposition of your assets at your death should be. A good Will includes what should happen if your spouse/partner survives you, what should happen if your spouse predecease you, and what should happen if you die at the same time. You should also think about what the disposition of your retirement funds are - you can specify a beneficiary for almost any financial asset you possess, and this will override the provisions in the will.

You need a Power of Attorney (POA). This will state who you wish to make non-health decisions for you if you are unable to do so yourself.
Again, you can specify a “backup” POA to act if your primary is unable or unwilling to do so. POAs usually are “springing”, which means that a specific condition must occur for the POA to come into effect. Usually, one or more doctors will need to certify to the incapacity of the person.

You need a Health Care Proxy.  This will state who you wish to make healthcare decisions for you if you are unable to do so.

You need Advance Directives, often called a living will. This is your statement of what you want your healthcare to be if you are unable to communicate this. This is where you might state that you do not wish extraordinary efforts to be taken to save your life. These might include “do not resuscitate (DNR)” or “do not intubate (DNI)” orders, and whether you wish a feeding tube to be used to feed you if you are not taking nutrition.

There might be other documents which should be prepared based on where you live or the special circumstances of your life.

If you haven’t done it, DO IT!  And if you have adult children, encourage them to do it. My wife and I were required to do this process in order to adopt a child. I think this should be part of marriage preparation and prepartum counseling. And the documents should be reviewed at each major life event (marriage, divorce, birth/adoption, death). Please, just do it."

Shopping LTC Insurance and I have a question,"The insurance broker sent us an estimate of policy cost and maximum benefits.

How did retiring from a desk job affect your back/neck/arm pain?,"Hello, long time reader, first time poster in this forum!

In a nutshell my questions are:

Did people with a desk job see a significant change in their pain after retirement? How long did it take things to change? Were there new pains that developed because of the change in lifestyle?

I am approaching retirement and have spent close to 30 years working in desk jobs, working partly as a programmer. I find myself grappling with various back and muscle issues that have been plaguing me for years. I'm curious to hear about your experiences and insights regarding the impact of retirement on back pain and overall health.

For over 15 years, I've struggled with persistent knots in my back, which have become more severe in the last year or two. The most concerning addition is a rope-like knot down the side of my neck that often feels like it's burning, as well as a knot that's been developing on my hip. My fingers and hand are also starting to hurt. 

I have a couple theories as to what's going on- 15 years ago is when I first got a smart phone and so it could be lots of time spent looking down and to the side to my phone. It could be the way I sleep and the kind of pillows I have. But I really think the big one is sitting at a desk. I invested in a sit-stand desk, have been going to a physio in the last month and a half, am doing the recommended exercises, getting acupuncture, changing up my pillows. But I wonder if it's just fundamentally having a desk job that's the problem.

How would you describe how your daily mobility changed in retirement? Can you paint a picture of the day in the life? There's the classic image of the retiree sitting all day in the lounge chair but that flies in the face of everything I've read. Nearly everyone says that they're busier than ever. It sounds a bit like that quote ""If I'd known grandchildren were so delightful I would have had them first""... ""If I'd known retirement was so full of life, I would've never left it to the end"".

I'm also wondering what I don't know that I don't know- are there new pains that emerge from not working at a desk? I remember some time a few years ago where I took off about 4-5 months and spent a lot of time hiking and one knee developed an issue that has never quite healed."
"I’m retiring at 63, will my SS be taxed at a excessive rate if I have a pension?","I will be retiring with generous pension, paid in social security for 40 years full time.  I’m told they will tax my SS benefit about 85%. I’m holding off applying until I know  for sure. I also have a small 401k that I don’t plan on touching until I am required to take minimum monthly distributions.

Edit: I felt really dumb asking this question, but not only did the replies help clarify the misunderstanding I had, but opened my eyes to a lot of other factors I was not aware of.

I am grateful for the knowledge being shared and I now have a road map of research that I have to do before pulling the trigger on Social Security.

Fortunately when I hang up my hat, I will have time to acquire the information I need to make the best decision possible. 

Thank you all for your input."
How is dating in retirement? Tips for people of a certain age? Annoyances that will get in the way?,"I’m not in this boat, but I know a bunch of you are out there. Is it easier to be flexible in what to do and what time to do it? Are you doing conventional dinner+ dates, or are you doing unusual things like river walks or museum crawls? How do you meet prospects? Are the kinds of things you talk about different than back when you were young? Are you set in your ways and does that hinder things? Are you comfortable with having a sometimes companion without it getting more serious? (Let's keep it clean, people. This is a SFW subreddit.)"
Please tell me how stupid it would be to quit my job,"I am 60 and single. This may sound dumb but I am just realizing what an absolute windfall my job is at this time of my life despite the fact that I have to live where I don't want to be. I really should stay for at least five more years, but I will go crazy unless I can see where I am going, if that makes sense.

I went back to college in my 40's. I had nothing. I graduated in 2012 at 48 and have moved up in my career to where I now make $150k/year. I get a significant bonus and pay raises every year. A promotion is possible. I have five years of service with the company, but have only actually worked here a year (long story).

My work made me move to another state, where I really do not want to be. I was actively looking for work back home, but I would be lucky to make half of what I do now. I have been so focused on not wanting to be here, that I think I am missing the gigantic lifeboat that I fell into...my job.

I just wasn't even thinking about retirement until I turned 60 a couple of weeks ago. Call me dense, but I just didn't think about it. I think I need to have a drastic change of thought! When I went back to school, I said it was so I didn't have to work at Walmart to keep the lights on when I am 70...and here I am.

So I have a measly $30k in my 401k. I do have it set to take 15% of my income, plus I get a 7% match. My company also puts 7% into a retirement fund that will vest in two more years. The amount should go up quickly. 

I also get a bonus, which can be 10-20% of my income.

My last SS statement said I would get like $3300 if I wait for 70. I think it was about $2500 at FRA. I am making way more money than I ever have so I think every year I work will take that amount up significantly.

I own three houses, which are rented. I clear about $1000/month in rents. My only debts are the mortgages on my houses. I owe $320k, but have at least $400k in equity.

I have never been a fan of keeping my money in funds. Typically, I would get a few thousand in a 401k, leave the job, buy a house. I figure I can either have a monthly rental income, or sell it if I need a bunch of cash.

Now I am thinking that I also need cash and/or to pay my mortgages off. It really pains me to pay off <3% money though.

I guess my current strategy is to just...to stick it out where I am. Quitting my job would be monumentally stupid, would it not? I am so lucky to have this at this time of my life and I was seriously thinking of throwing it away. Please tell me not to.

Also should I just save money, or should I pay down those <3% mortgages? It kind of pains me to do that, but it would increase my cash flow.

Question about taking Social Security early and working,"I will reach FRA in April, 2025. I plan on taking SS early, in Jan, 2024. I am still working and I understand that if I earn over the approx 22K amount, I will be subject to the $1 reduction per $2 earned. We plan on selling our house in the spring and then I will fully retire. If that goes to plan, I won't be much over the $22K exemption for the year, as I will only work for 4 months or so. My plan is to apply for benefits to start in Jan, 2024 and estimate my earnings to be $22K for 2024. I should then start to get benefits in Jan (paid in Feb) with no penalty. If I work the full year, they would need to withold about $15K (that would be 8 months of benefits, approx).

My question is: What happens if our plans change and we can't/don't sell our house and I continue working. Do I report the new estimated yearly earning then? Or, do I wait until the end of the year? If I report that my income will be higher, do they immediately start to withold benefits, or do they wait until the end of the year to recalculate?

I understand that the exemption will be higher for 2025 (the year I reach FRA), so no worries there. I just want to plan on WHEN my benefits might be stopped (during the year or after the end of the year) if I continue to work."
Question for the market-watchers: Would it make sense to sell shares of this mutual fund in my IRA?,"I have a non-Roth Fidelity IRA which I started in 2005 that is comprised of 6 mutual funds. One of those, a now-closed fund managed by Baron Partners, has had tremendous growth over the years - as of today it's at 718% increase in value from start between the growth of the stocks within the fund and my contributions. In the last couple of years, though, this fund has been more volatile than the other funds in my account, and after looking a little more deeply into it, I discovered that right now 47% of this particular fund's assets are in Tesla stock. This fund currently comprises 51% of my IRA value, and Tesla has been on a downward trend with respect to its stock price for the past couple of years so that concerns me. I've been thinking about selling some of those shares and moving that money into a different position or a new fund. (And personally I despise Musk and don't want to support him in any way. I know that's not an effective investment strategy, but blecch.)  
  
Would it make sense for me to do this now at age 60 as I look to retirement at 67? This account is a big chunk of my personal retirement change, and I'm wondering if this makes since because this is a closed fund which has been pretty successful, but then again, I question the fact that so much of the fund is in Tesla stock given its volatility. 

Related question - if you're a Fidelity account holder, what mutual funds are you investing in? Any recommendations for where I might move that money if I do sell some shares? My original parameters when I opened the account were funds that had shown a 20% growth in value over a 10-year period, and so far, the ones I've chosen have done pretty well.  
  
Thanks in advance!"

Starting up a weekly group meetup/hangout at some specific location,"I've seen two groups of retirees who go to the same location on the same day of the week to hang out.  One goes to a local watering hole and one brings lawn chairs to a park and circle up.  I was invited  to the watering hole meetup but it  was all men who've lived in town 30+ years.  Wife and I were new to town and I felt I wouldn't fit in.

I recently met two guys  at two different social gatherings,  and we all  had very similar careers (started programming computers in the 70s).   I really enjoyed the long conversations we had.  My wife and I have only met single women to socialize with,  I'm kind of missing male companionship,  my few long term male friends are scattered 400+ miles away.

Anybody ever start a weekly  tradition of a group of fellow retirees with a similar interess meeting up somewhere on a regular basis for conversation / companionship?"
To Sell v Rent out former home in current weird housing market?,"Found the perfect for us small (2 bedroom/2 bath) retirement home (rural) and bought it on the equity of our as yet still unsold Urban 4 bd-rm/3 bath and moved.

Musings and thoughts from a retired guy.,"Following numerous posts here and on AskReddit. Curious about your ideas/thoughts of retirement, and if your retired, is it all it's cracked up to be? Or more, or less? 

I've posted numerous times, that I'm now 13 months into retirement, technically jobless-ness. Fully unemployed. Just turned 62. Not yet applied for SS. What I deem a comfortable 401K stashed for when I turn 65. Not rich, but not poor. 

Worked my entire career white/blue collar jobs. Management to worker back and forth. 27 years at my last job, until the company was sold and we/I became a number, and not a name. When I originally hired, it was family owned, literally 2 brothers, 3rd generation company. As the brothers aged, there was no viable relatives or someone to just hand the keys over too. They sold it. Originally when I hired there were roughly 300 employees on the West Coast, stretching from CA to as far as Colorado. Very reserved company, very successful, the owners knew you on a first name basis. Sold, and absorbed into a company with ~10,000 employees country wide. You get the picture. But don't worry they said, the company that bought us out had the same values as ours did, nothing will change. Uh... WRONG. 

Once I became a number, it was time. It wasn't a fun family job anymore. I get it, no profit, no growth, no company, no job. Can't fault them. Of course I'd probably do exactly as they did. 

6 weeks after my resignation (had just turned 60) once the shock wore off, I realized that I was basically done with work life, corporate life, reporting to someone. Done. Free. No schedule except my own. 

Fast fwd. a bit. My first ever 6 week unemployed vacation was over, now what?!?! 

30 years of woodworking/crafting tucked in my belt. I have acquired plenty of tools and skills over this time. I have created some projects and made a few bucks over the years. However, it's a hobby. I could push it to increase sales and make some $ with it. Then it becomes a job, and not a hobby that replenishes my beer fridge. Maybe later for that part. 

A year into it, I decided I made the absolute correct decision. My new schedule includes, the daily chores my wife assigns (Mr. Mom) to maintain the house and keep it clean (windows/floors/vacuum/bathrooms etc.), then basically the day is mine. She is still working for another roughly 50 days from today.

So, other than a hard pre-scheduled thing, like the grocery, a Drs. appointment, home improvement store, I'm basically free of any schedule.

My new basic daily schedule includes morning TV, news, coffee and a few streaming shows. Never been a huge TV person, I just feel it unproductive. However now I'm catching 'flix recommending some shows I might have interest in, some I do, some eh, nope. This might add an hour here and an hour then. I still get up at 5:30am-ish most days, because it's programmed into me for most of my adult life. My wife of 33 years bless her heart basically took care of our kids when they were young, getting up with them at every hour under the sun. Finally she's able to sleep in to her heart's content especially on the weekends at least for another 2 months until she retires. I'm just not a long sleeper anymore. Time for a garage/shop woodworking project. What am I going to make/create today? I make custom cutting boards, charcuterie boards, name signs etc. The best part of this is, unless a customer is in a rush, I am not. I love being able to work for an hour, come in and take a break, work for another hour etc. Maybe grab a snack or an hour nap if I feel the need, then back to the shop. Along the way, neighbors come over for chit-chat. I love this part. 

I guess the point of this it to brag a little, because I've earned this. Also, to ask if your retired life is what you thought it would be. My in-laws, bless their heart's retired some 20 years (they have since passed on) ago. Neither had a fraction of a hobby or something to fall back on. They discovered the local Bingo/Casino, and ended up there 1 then 2 then 3 or more days a week. They never shared their financial casino status, so we never knew if they were ahead or behind. To me, that's not retirement.

I'd love to hear your retirement glee, or not glee.

I'm a pretty happy guy, though it's only been about 13 months in total. What will it be like in 2-5-10 years? Will I feel the same?"
Did your annual spending increase in retirement?,"I just read at article that cited a T Rowe Price survey which found that half of those surveyed reported that their annual spending increased by up to 25% after retiring. This was surprising because common wisdom is that post-retirement spending declines for most. And it's home-related expenses, not healthcare that is the biggest factor, according to the survey. So it's more than just inflation-related expenses. I'm wondering if I need to go back to the drawing board when calculating my anticipated retirement costs a few years from now. "
"For those not working, how late in the day do you get dressed?","I often wonder around in a robe and sandals, sometimes as late as 2:000PM. I rarely get dressed as soon after I wake up.

The main reason I get dressed is my wife works and when she comes home I don't want to appear shiftless and and lazy.  If I wasn't married, many days I may not get dresses at all.

I think it also depends on how long it's been since you last worked a job. "
Poll- Actions around personal finances,"Recently I was speaking with another parent about financial advice we gave our children. So when I read about this poll at a popular blog , the retirement manifesto , [https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com](https://www.theretirementmanifesto.com) (It is one of the blogs listed in the wiki of our subreddit 😉), I wondered about you.

**Which action contributed most to your personal financial success?**

Note I had to slightly alter due to choice limit and we can only vote for one due to poll design limitations. This is anonymous in that No one but you can see your personal selection and results are of the group. The source that the blog used, I cannot locate.

A friendship question....how do you interact with the opposite sex?,"I am a married, retired man.  Our gym has exercise classes.  Yoga.  Zumba.  Aerobics, stretching, etc.  At my senior center the vast majority of attendees are women.  

Most of them seem reluctant to talk to me.  Some do, and I've made some casual friendships.  But overall they are very reluctant to engage in any kind of conversation beyond casual small talk.  

My wife goes to the same gym, but she is not at all outgoing.  I've introduced her to some of my casual female acquaintances but she is not interested in making new friends.  My wife is friendly to people but she spends her time alone.

How is it with you all?  I feel most women keep their distance because I'm married.  But it would be nice to go over to the cafeteria after class and have a cup of coffee and talk.  

I think the issue here is obvious.  I'm more social than my wife.  But even the men at the gym are not interested in talking and socializing.  People seem to just want to got their own ways.  Is that how it is with you?"
Any words of wisdom for me? It might be time for me to retire from my current position,"It might be time to retire from my current job.  I'm having trouble concentrating and learning new things, and I need to learn as my role has changed.  I feel disconnected and not at all interested in what's been going on. I've been depressed for a while and I feel like I'm just not doing a good job.  I'm not getting negative feedback (except that I need to be more outgoing !!!).

Also, the company has enforced RTO 3-days a week if you live within a certain distance. I've been working remotely since 2018.  The company is laying people off and I had hoped to be on the list, but I don't think I can wait and I may never be on the list. I wanted to make it to 65 at least so I'd be eligible for Medicare.  I don't think I can make it to 2024.

I'm 64 and divorced. I may look into part-time remote jobs; maybe temp jobs and probably take SS soon.

The obvious downsides to retiring now are loosing benefits and a salary. My mortgage + HOA pmts are less than local rent (though we may have a 4k special assessment coming up). According to my 401K I have about 7 years until I'm in the red zone. I have a very small amount of savings.  ACA will be expensive. My other expenses are pretty low. My 2013 car is paid off.  Maybe I'd be better off leaving TX and moving back up to the northeast? I dream of traveling or living in a more urban area.

My parents died at 57 and \~62.  Thinking about everything that is happening in the world, it's possible my lifespan will be reduced.

Do you have any words of wisdom for me? Obviously I need to continue to work on my mental health.  I'm afraid I'll make the wrong decision. At the same time I believe my current work situation is contributing to my depression. My brain is swirling like a greasy marble.

&#x200B;

*11.10.23 - editing to provide more info.*  

Thank you all so much for the wisdom and suggestions.

 Re: mental health - I am seeing a therapist (I found her through my employer's EAP program) and a psychiatrist and taking meds which aren't helping. I've been diagnosed with treatment resistant depression. He's told me there are no other meds he can recommend for me.  I did take 3 weeks off in May for IOP. That was very helpful and led me to ACA mtgs, which are also helpful. I called my medical doctor to get an appt to talk about the memory and focus issues - she said to talk to the psychiatrist. He said my symptoms could be related to depression, but i should really have a medical workup. I have an appt with the med doctor in a few weeks. Hopefully she will hear me. 

Most of my family and 2 of my good friends are in the northeast.  Most of my friends are here in TX. I'm close with my ex-in-laws - they are outside of TX.

I completely lost interest in everything I loved over the the last year--camping, cooking, hiking, walking, music, craftiness, movies, being with friends. I know I need to get back to these activities for my physical and mental health. Another piece of socializing (and travel) is that I am doing everything in my power to not be exposed to SARS2. Something that has become apparent to me recently is that grief for people lost and opportunities, taking a right turn instead of a left, have left me yearning for chances to remake these decisions or have those opportunities or people in my life again.

I have thought about a lot of volunteer opportunities that I'd be interested in and feel like I need to start engaging now. I am fostering a dog, making an effort to journal and take short walks and meet friends for walks, and I'm planning to take a short road trip before the year ends. 

My current job is not my career, and I've not been on a career path. At this time, I just want to do my job and feel good about the work I do. And be a reliable colleague. If the work(place) is changing, and I'm not, then what? My intention never was to be at this company for as long as I have been. I was interviewing for jobs in my desired industry after finishing a degree when I was in my early 40s, but that didn't work out. 

One of my visions for retirement is spending time volunteering some part of the week, hiking/walking, walking on the beach, travel. I know these are activities I have to get back to participating in regularly (except for the beach - that's 4 hours away). I realize I need a more thoughtful plan, otherwise retirement will look like my life as it is today.

I'll never have a 1/2 million or so dollars for retirement. Compared to my family of origin, I'm doing good financially. I can pay my bills on time, buy groceries, pay my mtg, put money into a 401k ...  

I appreciate all of your comments. Thank you!

Retiring six weeks from now after 40 years of the 'same old same old'. I will be 66 early next year.  
Hopefully I'll have enough credits to survive late-stage capitalism in relative comfort until my demise. I'm planning on spending a lot of quality time with Mary Jane. God, I missed her!  
  
It's been such a long time. I think I should be goin', yeah. And time doesn't wait for me, it keeps on rollin'.........."
Social Security - early distribution math question,"I’ve been doing an analysis of whether to take social security early (before 67) or not, and I wonder whether I am doing the math properly.
 
If I compare taking SS at (a) age 62 versus 67, and also (b) age 65 versus 67, the ages at which I “break even” on cumulative distributions would be roughly 83 and 85, respectively, so not that big of a difference.  After that, I “lose” money compared to if I waited till 67.  So the first question is, does that math seem right?
 
Then the real difference occurs after that.  If I run the comparisons out to age 100, and average out the percentage of annual “loss” (as compared to starting age 67), then I essentially lose an average of 8.5% if distribution starts at age 62, or lose 3% if distribution starts at age 65.
 
If those numbers are right, I could probably compensate for the 3% by investing the earlier distributions.  But I feel like I need a head-check to see if I am doing this wrong.  Thoughts?"
Early Retirement When is the right time?,"I am 59 years old. I'm still working full time as an accountant- currently working from home 3x a week. I make a decent salary. My husband is 70 and is retired.  His age is a major consideration in my questions even though he is in good health. Currently we owe 20k on our house which we plan to keep. Our house will be paid off by the time I'm 62 which we planned, because we didn't want to take a mortgage into my retirement.  By the time I turn 62 we will have about 600k saved. Our debt is very low. Our cars are paid off.  I'm able to work until age 65, but I really don't want to at least not full time. I know I would get a better social security award if I wait until age 65. I would love for us to travel while we are able. Another consideration is my mother who is 86 years old and lives alone in another state where there is no other family living there. My father passed away 10 years ago.  She lives in California and I live in Florida and she will not move. I don't want to move to her state because it's too expensive. This issue is overwhelming me. Our family is small. She is going to start needing more assistance in the next few years. I'm trying to determine what is the best financial plan for me between now and ages 62-65. I don't want to be retired and financially tight. No one knows what the state of the world will be then, economy, social security, stock market etc., but I still need a plan. What should I make sure that I have in place if I decide to retire between ages 59.5 and 65 years old? What was your age and circumstances that made you say now is the time?

Edit:  I have  no out of pocket cost for my medical insurance. I will switch to Medicare at age 65."
"Picking a new ACA Plan for 2024. I am 61, retired and currently collecting SSI.","I posted this in r/healthcare and didn't get any responses.  Maybe someone here can answer?  I am retired to there is that :-)

I appreciate anyone who answers. I think I understand how this works, but would like to see if there is something I have not thought of or don't understand correctly. I think there is a 50% chance I will need surgery next year. Google says the procedure is minimally invasive and can cost between 6000-25,000 and can either be out patient or require one night stay. Other than that I am healthy, on one low cost prescription and don't go to the Dr. very often.  
  
I am assuming that premiums never count towards the deductible or out of pocket max.  
  
Plan A is free. It has a 7500 deductible and 9400.00 OOPM. Surgery is covered at 50% co-insurance. If the surgery above cost 25,000 I would play the first 7500.00, the the plan pays 50% for the next 19,000 at which time they plan pays the balance. Total cost for me is 9400.00.  
  
Plan B is 526.00 a month (6312.00 a year) with 0 deductible and 9400.00 OOPM. If the surgery above cost 25,000 I would pay 0 and then 50% for outpatient so I would pay half of the 25,000 (12,500) but I'd reach my OOPM before that so I'd pay 9400.00+I'd also pay 6312.00 a year for the premiums. Total cost of 15,712.  
  
  
  
It just seems like Plan B will only cost me 6312.00 more a year and not cover more.  
  
There is another plan with 0 deductible, 5500 OOPM and 30% coinsurance (hospital stay) and a 200.00 co pay for outpatient. That plan is 591.46 a month so 7092 per year with an OOPM of 5500.  
  
  
  
Am I thinking of all this is the right way?"
Please review my retirement numbers. Can I retire?,"Hello r/retirement, I am 65+ with a non-working spouse of 57 years and have the following assets:

401k +HSA + Taxable: $1.9 mil

Wife's TIRA: $150K

My Roth IRA: $56K

Non-401k Retirement from a prev. University job: $58 k

Company stocks which will 100% vest based on rule of 75: $80k

Cash accounts: $100k

I estimate my yearly expenses including taxes to be around $135k to $150K. I also have $28K from a Retirement medical account which I intend to use for my wife's ACA premium until she reaches Medicare age. I am planning on retiring when I reach FRA (66.5) next year. I am still debating between collecting Social Security at FRA ($41k) or waiting till 70 ($54k) or somewhere in between. Is it doable? Thanks!"
Sell house and downsize before or after retirement?,"My husband is set to retire in January 2025. He will be 65 1/2. We are going to be downsizing to a smaller home with everything on one level ( ranch style ), as I am already having some issues with stairs due to my osteoarthritis. Plus, our kids are adults with children of their own, so we don’t need as much space.
     We currently owe $23,000.00 on our mortgage. My husband wants to wait until the spring after he retires to put our house on the market. I think this is a bad idea and we should put the house on the market in spring of 2024, before he retires. I do not want a mortgage payment even 6 months after he retires. He says we can cash in on some investments and pay the $23,000.00 off. I don’t want to take anything from our investments to pay off the remainder of the loan. That is money we will need to live on in retirement. We have a decent amount to retire on, around $700,000.00. Taking $23,000.00 to pay off our mortgage may not “ seem” like a lot, but to me, it is.
        My thought is to sell this coming spring, and paying outright for a smaller home, thus going into retirement with no mortgage. I can’t seem to get him to see where I’m coming from. Does anyone agree with me or am I in the wrong or being unreasonable?"
I'm torn between travelling and nesting...,"60 yo single male, no kids here. Retirement is on the horizon, but I have **two conflicting visions** of what the first few years of my retirement should look like.

On one hand, I'd like to buy a mid-size truck with cabover camper (think Four Wheel Camper) and travel around the US and Canada for a couple of years.  I roadtripped A LOT in my 20's-40's, and there's TONS of places I'd still like to visit.  The downside is the expense of gas and campgrounds and, as I've gotten older, camping out (and the solitude) has lost a lot of it's allure.  Plus, I have a cat at home that I adore and provide for.

Conversely, I have  a comfortable home (rental) space.  I stay very active riding my mountain bike during the summer and cross country skiing during the winter.  Boredom, and a lack of things to do is not an issue.  But I also have multiple health issues that, even though they don't restrict me (too much) from being active and travelling, maintaining a close proximity to my various medical providers is a good idea.  Having a home base also allows me to stay somewhat socially connected to a few friends and to my community, whereas I tend to be keep mostly to myself while travelling.

Who else has dealt with a similar dilema while entering retirement, and how have you structured your retirement to accommodate both an interest to travel and the enjoying the comfort of your home and community?"
401k - can you convert active to a managed account?,"Not sure this is an option, but I have an active 401k with my employer and I was thinking about having it managed.   Has anyone converted an active 401k to an IRA and had it managed?    My returns have been ok but they could be better."
"Those of you with part time jobs in retirement, how are you liking that?","I’m working retail, and I was worried that shifts would overly get in the way of other things I like to do, like my weekly dinner with a group of friends, volunteer work, church services, workouts. So far, though, it’s been pretty workable. Plus, I like the job. How about you?"
"Social Security timeframes vary, why is that?","First a bit of backstory. I’m still five years away from retiring. I set my goal at 65, and with an IRA and 401k currently sitting at 700k, I feel comfortable with my five year plan. Especially with our only debt our house, which we hope will either be fully paid off, or pretty close to it. 

Looking at when to start taking SS is an interesting one and it seems there are so many competing views on when to start taking it. I know people are in different financial positions when they retire, but I would think something like what works best would be straight forward regardless of that. 

So why are there competing views on it? And on a personal level I’d be interested in hearing if anyone regrets when they started taking their SS. 

Thanks!

Update: While I may not have responded to all the comments, I have read 99% of them (I'm sure I missed one or two along the way). But overall, seems we're just as divided as the 'experts'. To be really clear, my plan is not to work again after I retire at 65. My wife who is a few years younger than I am will have to work for a couple more but that's even better because I won't have to touch anything until she retires, then we can start pulling SS and our retirement savings accounts). I can't personally thank all of you, but thanks all of you!"
Wondering how other retired folks spend time in the evenings,"I’ve been retired for almost two years and I’m pretty content with my mix of activities during the day. Some active, some relaxed. Some purposeful, some for fun. Some social, some alone. Some at home, some out and about.

But I’m still trying to figure out the evenings. One night per week is for ‘date night’ at a local restaurant with my wife. And I have a few nights a month with social activities or church events. But that leaves a fair number of evenings where TV is the all-too-easy choice. So I’m looking for ideas of how others spend routine evenings, especially now that it’s too dark for yard work. 

Thoughts?"
Spending guidelines/buckets in retirement,"During the working and saving years, there are various rules of thumb about how to apportion earned income.  For example, there is a 50/30/20 rule that breaks things up into percentages of Needs, Wants, and Savings.  There's a guideline about not exceeding 30% of income on housing, and another about keeping all fixed costs in the 50-60% range.

All of these seem primarily aimed at helping people reserve a portion of income for the future, and to help them avoid committing to costs they ultimately can't afford.

But when one has reached retirement, perhaps with a paid off house and no more significant investing, what guidelines exist for us?  This is something I've pondered a lot recently as I approach the end of tracking our expenses for the second year in a row.

We're on target this year to spend about 30% of our total outflow on discretionary expenses, the *Wants* if you will.  This implies that 70% of the money we're spending is for obligations, the *Needs*.  I'm not sure how I feel about that, although to be fair, I'm in my mid-50s and have two kids in college, so it's not a state that will persist forever.  Ideally I'd like to spend 100% on fun things!

If you are the type who budgets your spending, what if any guidelines or limitations do you observe?"
Did you retire when you ran out of clothes?,"This is half-serious, but I wonder if anyone decided to retire rather than buy new clothes for work?

I (66 M) work in higher education as professional staff, and my office dress isn't particularly formal--basically, khakis and oxford shirts. With 18 months of remote work and another year of 3 days/week in the office, my clothes haven't been subject to a lot of wear and tear recently. But I've been in person full-time for the past year, and I'm starting to face the need to replace worn-out clothes.

I could retire now, and I have been thinking about doing it in the next few years. I'm not sure I want to spend a bunch of money now on clothes that I won't need in the near future.

So it may be a silly question, but did this factor into anyone's timing of their retirement?"
I need to get a plan in order but not sure how to go about it,"I have to start taking RMD's next year. I am currently working part-time. I am thinking of stopping work Jan 1 or shortly thereafter. I have always handled my own taxes and finances, but I think it's time (or past time) to get a plan together. 

I am seeking guidance on ideas like should I seek a fee-only CFP; a CPA; go with my 401K adminstrator or maybe tranfer to Schwab or Fidelity; or maybe just use online calculators and do it myself.

Thank you for your advice."
Gathering around your dining table.,"With a crunching sound, we slowly pull into the gravel parking lot. Once inside the clapboard building I make my way to a dining table for 4. “You can’t sit there” my Uncle says. “Bob sits there”. We sit at the table next to it and proceed to order. Quickly the original table fills up with similar white haired men with weathered worn faces from years of farm work, all sipping coffee.

He turns to the group. “This is my niece visiting from y“. They get energized and share the last time they were in my “neck of the woods” or which of their relatives have moved near there. My uncle, living in the home he grew up in and on the land his family settled as a homestead, has known these folks his entire life.

Now as I inch closer to my retirement I wonder, who will be at my table?"
Golden Handcuffs - How and When Should I Break Free?,"This is a really tough decision.  I love my job and am well compensated.  I love the people I work with.  My work life balance is good, not great.  That is mostly my doing because I get a lot of fulfillment from my work.  My SO is retired and I don't need to work.  But leaving is so much harder than I expected.  What frameworks have people in my situation used to apply decision making criteria to this situation?  TIA."
Question about timing for Medicare sign up.,"Here’s the deal.  My spouse turned 65 in July.  He signed up for Part A same month.  Still on my plan this year.  He needs traditional Part B with a plan G Medigap and a Plan D, to start January 1st.  The tricky part for us is that he sold a small business in 2021.  So, the only time in his life he had a high enough AGI to disqualify him for the lowest tier MC premium was two years ago. Hence the wait till 2024. He looked on the website yesterday and was confused by the verbiage stating he’d be penalized if he didn’t sign up for a Plan D by Oct 31st. 

 I did speak to a broker about this whole scenario. She’s got a G and D plan that is agreeable but seemed confused about our timing and was unable to answer my questions about potential penalties or IRRMA. He has a lot of heath issues so I don’t want to him to have to go through a qualifying event for his medigap plan. I’m trying to get this right the first time with a minimum of hassle.  If we wait till after Oct 31st will we be backtracking with a lot of extra paperwork?  Or can we sign him up with a delayed start time and they’ll look back to 2022 tax return as is appropriate?  I’m kind of floundering. Hope someone can advise. Thanks!"
Looking for Financial Planning tool recommendations,"What application or planning tools do you recommend?

Retiring from feds in 10 days and I'm nervous,"I posted up here a bunch. I am (was?) an IRS engineer for the past 17 years. My grade (13) became an embarrassment for the work I was doing (the largest cases). I turn 65 in 10 days and that is the trigger. I have been very depressed about my job for the past two years.i also got cancer, which I am beating, and am not sure how much longer i got.

And I like my field and enjoy helping people. So I plan on building a brand of me, after i retire, through articles I will write and a free training. Will it work? Not sure. 

Honestly my entire being was so wrapped up in my job. Are there any online sessions for the newly retired?"
How do you all spend your time in retirement (59F and 69M couple)?,"Me (59) and my husband (69) both retired in 2021, and over the last 2 years we basically just traveled around the world to the places that we simply didn't have time to go to when we were still working. Now, we've basically crossed most if not all places we wanted to visit off of our 'checklist', and we are wondering what we are going to do for the next however many years we have left.  
We have one son who we are quite close to (we still live in the same city, and him and his girlfriend visit us once or twice a week), but neither of us have very close friends. I can count on one hand the number of friends who I've had an actual in-depth chat with over the past year.  
Financially speaking we are doing quite well, at the moment we are basically living off our monthly pensions without touching our investments since we grew up in poor families and we always stayed frugal. Now that we're retired we have even less of a desire to spend money on superficial/useless things, I'm perfectly happy with my $40 shoes and I literally don't understand why people would want to spend (tens of) thousands of dollars on jewellery/bags/outfits.  
As for hobbies, we were so focused on our professional lives during our working years that we pretty much never developed any hobbies. When I see people around me who have hobbies/activities that they can spend a lot of time on and that they actually enjoy, I get quite envious as I can't ever imagine myself being so dedicated to something.  
So now when we're home, I purposely look for menial tasks and chores to do to pass the time (that, by the way, I hated doing when I was still working). Nowadays I will happily spend half a day buying groceries and preparing a meal for my family. I'll go to the post office to pay our bills in person even though I could easily do this online.  
I wouldn't say I'm unhappy though. 'Content' would be a great word to describe what I'm feeling at the moment, but I'm definitely lacking a goal or target to achieve. Is this normal? Any other retirees feel the same as I do?"
Boglehead Conference Day 2 - retirement/preretirement track,"Here is as short a synopsis I could make for day 2 of the Bogleheads Conference in Rockville Maryland. I attended the retirement/preretirement track. Next door was the accumulator track (note the talk there on how to pay for college). The agenda with downloadable slides is here https://boglecenter.net/2023conference/ - in a few weeks all of the session will be viewable online as they were recorded. I also met our moderator u/Mid_AM there! There was a book signing with all the authors present. Overall, a very well organized learning experience - highly recommended.

**Gerald O’Reilly from Vanguard in Conversation with Rick Ferri**

 - Gerald O’Reilly is the manager of the $1.3 trillion Vanguard total stock market fund. Vanguard manages over $4 trillion which is 10% of the US stock market. Excellent interview with a peak behind the curtain of what a fund manager does. The bottom 3% of stocks making up the total US stock market index are more illiquid than the top 1500 stocks, so most of the team’s time is spend managing these stocks. About 25% of trades they do occur in the last 25 minutes of the day. Much of their manpower on a daily basis is to ensure no tracking error with the benchmark indexes due to splits/reverse splits/IPOs etc. They estimate over $334 billion in savings for investors through low cost index funds from 1993-2021.


**Bogleheads Investing Experts Panel**

 - The panel included Jonathan Clements, Bill Bernstein, Dana Anspach, Paul Merriman, Jim Dahle and Rick Ferri. Karen Damato was moderator and they answered investing questions. Inflation is identified as one of the 4 Horsemen that can decimate a retirement portfolio. Having stocks in the portfolio and waiting until 70 for social security were viewed as protection. Dana Anspach noted inflation is more important in early retirement and not so much in the slow-go and no-go years as we age. They discussed concentration risk for stocks especially for holding the top 7 stocks. Your ability to stick with your portfolio is more important than the mix of asst classes you have. A simpler portfolio is easier to stay with. Paul Merriman says you need to know how much you are willing to lose (can you stand a 50% drop in your portfolio?). Bill Bernstein notes how you do in the long term is largely based on how you act during the worst 2% of time. They discussed lump sum investing vs DCA. Also discussed was all US stocks vs including international stocks too. Finally having a bond ladder is superior to using a bond fund – but is a pain to setup. 

**Charley Ellis in conversation with Jonathan Clements**

 - Charley Ellis says Jack Bogle had a dream and a nightmare – nightmare he would be forgotten (so he wrote books). Charley discussed tennis as an analogy for investing – for ordinary players outcome is based on who loses the most. If you cut back on mistakes you will have a better outcome. He felt active managers are in competition with each other – not with the market itself. Modern day investment tools are the great equalizer for the retail investor. They discussed David Swensen – conceived derivatives transactions; invented endowment model. Charley felt he was the best investor he had seen – went to Yale (The Yale Model). He put together a great team through seminars and growing gifted students internally. Yale’s investment board member longevity is 17 years. He felt Jack Bogle was a terrible manager, but excellent leader. (computers too damn much – didn’t understand computers). Didn’t like ETFs (speculative). Bogle didn’t like computers, or ETFs (felt they were too speculative). That being said **Jonathan noted there are only two groups of people who walk past a statue of their boss every day – people in North Korea and people at Vanguard (Jack Bogle’s statue)**.

 - Wade Pfau discussed retirement portfolios and how the 4% rule doesn’t work world-wide. (Wade had plenty of slides which can be viewed at the link above). He identified key retirement risks. Modern portfolio theory only addresses asset allocation. What about longevity risk (an actuarial problem); macro/market risks; inflation; personal spending. He then identified four retirement styles (see 4 block matrix slides): Total return – CORE; Income protection/flooring approach -(Included social security/pensions/annuities etc) CORE; Time segmentation (bucketing) – BEHAVIORAL; Risk wrap – BEHAVIORAL. How do you like to withdraw retirement income? This is behavioral – Wade uses 12 questions to see if you are Probability based? VS Safety First? Optionality VS Commitment orientation? He discussed variable withdrawal strategies; the role of annuities to allow stocks to grow unhindered to protect for inflation; cases for whole life insurance; and who might consider a reverse mortgage.
 
**Breakout session decumulation: Jon Luskin, Mike Piper, Wade Pfau, Christine Benz**

 - The panel was asked many questions> the first was if it was OK to retire in the next 1-2 years with the current economy. Now is a good time with interest rates increasing. The discussed the upcoming cap for medicare part D drug costs **capped at $2000 out of pocket in 2025.** When can I retire? Flexibility in retirement plan/spending is good. Wade Pfau likes the funded ratio approach instead of Monte Carlo simulations – if you are over 100% using future value calculations you are in good shape to retire. Mike Piper liked Monte Carlo simulations to look at what year it may fail. The consensus was a Monte Carlo score of 90% is good if you are only doing a one-time snapshot. But if you plan on adjusting your retirement plan and look at it yearly, then a Monte Carlo score of 70-80% might be OK. One of the big behavioral issues is learning to switch to using your money instead of being a saver. How to address Long Term Care? They discussed separate silo/bucket/self-fund. Long term care policy vs hybrid. Mike Piper said it was best to research actual facility costs where you live since costs are so location specific. LTC can be $100,000 the first year. Mike Piper has worked with people who could have retired 7 years prior and anxiety is real/external – it is OK to seek mental health care. They discussed inheritance – getting smaller amounts at a younger age is much more impactful (house/student loans etc) vs getting 7 figure inheritance at 65 is not as impactful. They also discussed bonds – research shows the sweet spot is intermediate term/5 years. Also discussed Roth vs traditional; paying off home before retirement; popular software like MaxFI, New Retirement, Flexible Retirement Planner. Flexibility to change your plan is more important than what software you use.

**Jon Luskin interviews Dana Anspach**

 - Dana was asked what the 3 most common tax mitigation strategies long term? Roth conversions; manage gains/losses; qualify people for tax credits for healthcare subsidy.
 - Age in bonds – not a fan. Kitces with bond tent during retirement red zone.
 - Roth conversions? Takes a lot of analysis to see if this is right to do.
 - Role of private equity? Short sarcastic answer is “none”. Long answer – her experience is almost everyone loses money except for 1 person. Is it worth adding higher risk for possible higher reward? Illiquid. More appropriate > 20 M portfolio. But high fees/costs.
 - Where do retires leave money on the table? Lack of planning. Look at leaving quality of life on the table instead which will resonate better with frugal people who are afraid of spending their portfolio.
 - Are TDF (edit - target date funds) adequate? Yes – but best to stay with your plan, don’t jump ship and switch strategies. Many adequate strategies/portfolios (Jim Dahle has list of different 100 portfolios). When is it not appropriate? Dana says they are paid first to manage risk etc – so would not use TDFs for her clients. 
 - What are big mistakes people have made we can avoid? Someone retiring at 65 – lost $80,000 to ponzi scheme. Widow remarried – moved assets to another firm – signed away ¾ of portfolio without realizing it. Concentrated stock risk – they refuse to sell/derisk. Intel portfolio went from $10M to $3M 2001.
 - If you have lots of assets/annuity/real estate and don’t need to touch portfolio – OK all equities without cash/bonds? Yes. Saw lots of dividends get cut in half in 2000’s (they did not have enough in cash/fixed).
 - Advice if over 50? Dana is 52, and 100% stocks currently – she would start setting up a bond ladder starting at 55 if market is good for anticipated 65 yo retirement. 
 - Resources for annuities: Immediateannuities.com; Stan the annuity man; DPL Financial Partners/RetireOne (works only for advisors/RIAs).
 - What to do with $1M single stock cost basis $350K? Depends on other assets to mitigate risk of going to $0?
 - What type of bonds for your bond ladders? Bullet shares maybe for corporate, but usually treasuries, muni, CDs. Rather take risk on equity side.
 - Leave 401K alone or roll over when you retire? Look at investment selections – can’t do bond ladders as easy in 401K. Change from 401K to IRA will have blackout periods during transfer. 401K and IRA have separate RMD cannot consolidate like you can with 2 IRAs."
"FYI if you want to know the details of Medicare, get it straight from","Medicare.gov themselves, especially folks like me who are not there yet, namely for US folks.

Modern Day financial instrument replace LTC Insurance,"Hi, Im getting ready to retire early. My parents have passed but they both needed to move to an assisted living facility toward the end, and fortunately they both had LTC policies that we could tap into. So I asked my advisor about LTC policies for me and he mentioned Lincoln Moneyguard. This doesn't exactly work the way my parents policies did,  you put in a lump sum today and get an even bigger lump down the road when you need it, I'm not going to go into all the details, you can look it up.  What I want know is if anyone has experience with this company/policy, because I did some googling and I found one particular site where everyone is complaining about Moneyguard. But they're not the only company offering a policy of this type, and if you would recommend a different one please post. Thanks!"
Retiree Medical Savings Account (RMSA). Is it worthwhile or should I just save on my own?,"I just realized that my employer offers a Retiree Medical Savings Account (RMSA). They do NOT contribute at all, but guarantee at least 5 percent interest. There appears to be some tax benefits, but I can’t find information about the negatives. I do not own a home so am saving for a down payment; hoping Incan buy a home when I retire in 5 to 8 years (yes, I realize that seems ridiculous).  Do any of you have a RMSA? Any advice on if it is worthwhile?  Thanks so much for your thoughts."
Happy vs unhappy in retirement :: a question for this sub 🤔,"Friend and I were chatting the other day. He wondered out loud, ""I wonder what the percentage of people in retirement who are vs those who are unhappy.""

I'm not sure if that data is reliably available but WHY someone would be *unhappy* in retirement is the interesting question. I think two big ones are 1) that person's identity was wound up and tightly integrated with his/her former occupation and/or 2) his/her social support system was overwhelmingly consisting of people from said former occupation. Lack of outside (non work related) interests would be another factor. 

Wondering what this sub thinks? Fwiw my friend says, ""man, if there was ever a sure thing it's you being ecstatic in retirement."" 😂 looking like I'll be able to pull the trigger in about 14-16 months (I'll be 61 then) and I. Cannot. Wait. Getting all my financial ducks in a row is the stressful part. I need to make this happen STAT."
Transition from salary to investment income worries.,"So, I am 9 days out from telling my boss I am retiring. I am so excited, but transitioning from a salary to income is really messing with me. We have gone over it with our financial planner many times as I have been planning to retire now for 2 years and have just been too nervous to pull the trigger. Even left my company of 10 years thinking a new challenge would keep me going. I have realized I am done with corporate after a bit over a year here. Anyway, we just discussed with the planner last month (again for at least the 5th time) where the funds will come from for our income. I just feel this weird feeling I can only equate to a lack of trust that the actual amount of money we have planned will show up. Anyone else have that feeling as they transition?"
"No desire to move up, take on more, at work. Are these signs of moving towards retirement?","I've always done my job. And there remains no issue there. But I have absolutely no desire to take on more at work. No desire to maintain, much less accept more, leadership. 

I still like what I do. But I'm just not feeling it now, in general terms. 
I figured I would retire anytime in the next two to four years. Now, I'm thinking it might be two or less!

Were there times when you just didn't feel like engaging at work prior to retirement?"
How to prepare for retirement at 49 and no savings or 401k,"Well as the title said I’m F49. I’ve never been married and I don’t have any children. I do not own a house and have about $2000 in my checking account. I make about $58K a year. I’ve had some health problems this year so I’m working on paying down a $8,000 hospital bill. (That was my out of pocket max). Other than that I don’t have any debt. My question is, what is the best way for me to start preparing for old age/retirement. Am I to late? My mom is still alive but she didn’t prepare either and I don’t want to be in her position."
Near retirement age but would still like to advance my career,"I could conceivably retire in two years but would still like to advance my career.  What are some thoughts on considering a job change this late in my career? I could coast to retirement in my current role but would like to test the waters in a more advanced role elsewhere.  I enjoy what I do currently but would like a challenge.  I'm also considering a few additional certifications (lean, agile).  Has anyone experienced a late career move close to retirement?"
Anybodu have experience with travel insurance cost?,"So hubby just turned 65 and we are comparing Medicare options...the coverage he will have through my employer includes a robust and financially reasonable Medicare advantage plan, but it doesn't include coverage while out of the country. 

We plan on slow travelling Europe (a month or two at a time), and we are trying to decide if its better to stick with the coverage he would have through my work + outside travel insurance, or to forego that employer-sponsored coverage, pay out of pocket, and get a medigap with the 80% travel coverage. 

The unknown at this point is how much travel insurance costs...does anyone have experience buying travel insurance for something like this? Is it super-pricey for a month or two/year?"
Transitioning from AHA to Medicare question,"  
My wife and I are currently on Obamacare. She turns 65 on February 25, thus will go on Medicare. Do we sign her up for AHA for two months, or can she go on Medicare since she is so close at the beginning of the year? I tried searching online and can't find this info. 

Also, I have a few years to go and will stay on the AHA. Wondering how this will work as as far as income, I mean we're still a family, so hopefully because I'll be on AHA I'll get the same premiums that we've been getting? Not sure. Thank you! "
Announcing retirement to my boss today for end of year.,"It’s getting real!  I’m meeting with my boss today to let him know my plans and prepare an exit strategy.  I work at a government agency with no risk of getting booted upon the announcement.

**EDIT- Meeting went well.  He's happy for me and a bit jealous.**

Over the weekend I was having a few second thoughts but this morning the first song on my playlist was “Chicken Fried” by Zac Brown Band:

*It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most* 

*Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes* 

*There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind* 

*This I've come to know*"
The biggest advantage to retirement is predictability.,"I'm retired,  and I'm pretty sure that I can stay retired until I am unable to think for myself.   I think the greatest advantage to retirement is that you don't feel dependent on a job, or a patron,  or much more than general world stability to continue doing what you are doing.   When people ask themselves,  ""can I retire? ""   the answer is always:  can you keep on keeping on under most expected circumstances,  and then you can live each day without worries.  "
Has anyone moved in retirement from their longtime home or hometown?,"I guess the real question is based on this:  wife (57f) and I (M59) moved from the area we both grew up in two years ago. We traveled the US for a year in our RV prior to settling in an area we liked.
If you have, how did it work out?  Were you able to meet people and make some friends? (We're struggling) What did you do to meet people? The people around are really nice (nicest we met anywhere but our ethnicity doesn't quite meet the majority demographic)
We probably won't stay here another summer as it was just too darn hot, but we will absolutely be here Oct-end of April as it is just perfect weather.

Any ideas or advice would be helpful, if you want to share your experience that would be great as well.

Edit: To be clear, we knew going in that we were moving to an area where we would be in the minority and while I find that different, I don't feel it is a barrier as the people are very friendly. Their culture (Hispanic) is very family centric and I admire that very much.
Edit 2:  Since my wife and I had a business in the area from which we moved (after 50+ years) we knew quite a lot of people, but to be fair, we had an extremely small ""friend"" group mostly built around our kids. As the kids have grown and gone, our contact had decreased markedly.  I am outgoing and tend to meet people easily but my wife doesn't find it to come naturally.  We have always been each other's best friend, so even though we haven't met a friend group yet, it is not much different than our life in our hometown.  Mostly we are looking for ideas and to hear the stories from people who took the leap like we did.

Thanks for the replies!"
I can't wait.... till I wake up in a total panic,"Shooting for next July 1st after chickening out last July.  Usually,  I can imagine unlimited fun and relaxation. (plenty of healthy activities on the back burner. Then,  I'll realize how fortunate I've been to have found this work, and all it's done for me, and I immediately imagine myself as miserable and useless and bored.

How much do YOU think you need in retirement?,"I've listed all my retirement money and come up with a monthly figure that is the amount I will have in retirement. I've calculated it assuming my stocks will stay the same value and not increase or decrease (big assumption). I know I'll need more in my 60s and less in my 80s, but I've divided what I have with the number of months left until I'm 90 and I have a number. how do I know if it's enough? What do YOU think is the number you would like to see here.

"I have an older spouse, should I retire now?","My spouse is 15 years older than me. I'm within 5 years of full retirement age. Spouse is walking slower, napping more, going deaf, having health concerns accelerate with a chronic disease -- just typical getting older so far. But I'm not there yet. I want to enjoy good times with my spouse while we still can, local travel, walks, visiting friends -- and I'm working a low paying job that makes me tired instead.

How do I figure out if I can afford to quit my job to spend time with my 15 year older spouse before it's too late to enjoy ourselves?"
Yikes! IRMAA is going to hit the wallet this year,"As the title states, the  IRMAA surcharge is going to happen in 2024 for our Medicare Part B  I was unable to manipulate revenue from 2022 low enough to avoid the surcharge.

Bogleheads Conference - Day 1 - The Case For And Against Factor Investing. Or - helping my grandkids,"Paul Merriman recently caught my attention on a recent podcast (How To Money #734 – Turning Thousands Into Millions with Paul Merriman). The short premise is that investing in a 2 fund portfolio has the potential to outperform the S&P500 over very long time horizons. The reason is that historically small cap value (SCV) stocks have outperformed the S&P500 by 2% or so since 1926. **Here is the interesting part - he is putting $365 - $500 into a portfolio each time a grandchild is born. It is a 50:50 mix of an S&P500 index fund and a small cap value fund (such as AVUV)**. He tries to get it into a Roth as soon as possible. Letting that fund grow, it will have a value of $1 million dollars at age 67 for his grandchild. On their first birthday he repeats the process, etc until they are 18. **He has fully funded their retirement from age 67 - 85 at $1M per year.**

Paul Merriman gave a 20 minute presentation today at the Bogleheads Conference discussing the same thing taking the position that you should consider factor investing (at least in SCV) with a tilt of at least 10%. You can download the actual slides presentations under ""Track 2: Bogleheads 501"" [here](https://boglecenter.net/2023conference/). (EDIT - the actual videos will be available at some point on this website too if you want to watch the presentations)

To be fair, Rick Ferri took the opposing view for 20 minutes arguing why you should NOT consider a tilt towards small cap value. He points out that the prima for this seems to have disappeared over the past 18 years. That backtesting is not necessarily reality. That you would have to wait decades to potentially be rewarded. That you have the risk of tracking error. And there are behavioral costs likely to make you want to throw in the towel if it doesn't work your way.

I included additional resources regarding this. Ben Felix's own portfolio is tilted towards SCV and can be seen below:

 - Ben Felix Model Portfolio - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPlC_Miyz70
 - Example Ben Felix Portfolio - https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/ben-felix-model-portfolio/

If you have or will have grandkids - this is an interesting idea to ponder. I know it is a little tangential to OUR retirement, but imaging if you had a grandparent who had the foresight to do the same for you."
Can I contribute 100% of working pay to a 401k? As long as I don't go over yearly max?,I'm retired and collecting social security. I'm considering going back to work part time but I don't want to add much income. I don't need the $ and it will only cause my health insurance to cost more. I would like to contribute to my IRA tho. Can I do that? Contribute 100% or close to it to my IRA? If a company offers 401K can o direct that to my IRA?
Was at financial planner and got a post for this sub,"I never thought to look for a retirement sub.
I was literally with my financial planner going over my plan to pull the plug next May and a retirement post popped up. I have been on Reddit two years and have never seen one. I guess  big brother really is watching. I figure I may as well lurk around here and see what I can learn."
Pay Off Debt or Invest Proceeds From Rental Property?,"I have sold rental property and have about $350G from the sale.  I am 61 and plan to retire at the end of this year.  My wife is 63. We have about 1Mil in investments, mostly stock and bonds.  I would appreciate some feedback regarding how to best use the $350G.  I have loans as below:

Amount	    Percent	Mo Paymt

$7,000.00 	   5%	 $750.00      Loan to bury a friend

$206,918.38    2.88%	 $1,770.16   Mortgage

$19,291.00 	   2.74%	 $632.00      Car1

$19,652.45 	   1.9%	 $533.67      Car2

$7,502.00 	   0%	 $300.00      Air Con Replacement

**$260,363.83 	         $3,985.83**

What would be best?
1. Put all the $350G into 401K and pay off nothing.
2. Pay off some of the debts and which ones?
3. Pay all of the debts and coast in debt free.

We currently live on about $6500 per month with these debt payments.  After I retire we will be pulling in about 8G from my spouse's salary, draws from retirement and rental income.  We do not plan on touching social security until 65 respectively.

Thank you in advance for any guidance."
Other social media apps for “mature” users?,"I’ve about had it with Reddit.

How to stop the AARP magazines from being mailed?,"Figured this question makes sense to ask here. How do I stop the AARP magazines from coming? I signed up for AARP earlier this year for the AT&T cell phone discount and hotel discounts (well worth it, I’ve saved a ton of money from the membership). However, I have no interest in reading anything written by AARP and they keep mailing the magazines. Huge waste of tree paper since it goes directly in the trash.

"Looking for ideas on where to retire. Need warmth, beaches, books, good food and legal gambling!","As I get closer to retirement, the “where” starts to loom larger.  I realize this might be a lot of trial and error, so not feeling locked in to one particular place, but I do know some of the things I want which will make me happiest.

Like a lot of retirees, I want warm weather, preferably with access to the beach.  I’d also like good food and the ability to travel.  I know Spain and Portugal are popular spots for this, although as someone raised in the American South, I wonder how warm their water is.  The Caribbean also feels like it might be a good starting point, although it would be more difficult to travel from their if I wanted to move around.

I’d also like access to good bookshops and if I wanted to reach part-time, that might be nice, although hardly a deal breaker.  Finally, I’d like to be able to watch (and occasionally gamble on) American sports!  So while Asia might be nice to visit, I don’t want to be trying to watch an NFL game at 1 a.m. local time if possible.  Appreciate any thoughts if anyone else has (or had) similar thoughts to mine and where they ended up.  Thanks!"
Parent's RMD as income replacement/selling property to retire early,"Hello - pardon the throwaway. I've been pretty active in this sub under my other name, and I'm really apprehensive about asking this question.

I just found out my company is being sold in Q1 24. I feel like I am in a pretty vulnerable position given my age (56) and position. I've been pretty stressed about it.

I was not planning to retire until the traditional retirement age - maybe a bit earlier if I could figure out the health insurance part. I am on track on my own for retirement (no debt, house paid off, good 401k balance, etc.).

Now to the question. I am the sole caretaker of and beneficiary to my 85 year old parent. Over the last year since his health started declining, we have put all the POAs, etc in place and I have taken over his financial life and am on all his accounts. He has already moved into a retirement community and has plenty of money to provide for his care for at least 20 years, probably more. He knows I am stressed about my work, and is encouraging me to either go ahead and sell his property, or just use his RMD as my income and consider retiring now. 

I feel very uneasy about this, as it just doesn't feel right to me. This is my dad's money and will be until he's gone, but I told him I would consider it. 

My question is - I know he can't gift me over the limit yearly without tax implications, but he says there's no tax implication for him if I just use his account for my living expenses since my name is on the account too. Is this true? Thank you all for your advice/input."

"Change is going to come no matter what, so get along little doggies!","This Reddit topic really has got me thinking. As we enter a new phase of life we should accept our changes just as we did when growing up from a child to teen, to young adult and adulthood. Our bodies changed our priorities, our desires, dreams, and means all changed. We are entering another phase that may cause some of us fear and dread but remember we aren’t yet dead. Seek out the person you want to be at this stage and place. While our bodies may shrink or grow larger in all the wrong places, we can keep our minds strong by eating well and daily exercise, a little laughter and company, travel or a walk is all good. Let’s try to go with the flow. I will if you can too."

I had planned to start back on a few hobbies and personal goals. Although I didn't get everything accomplished today there is always another day. It has been great following this thread to help with the mental change of stopping work. 

The best thing was not having the stress of eventually going to work. It is a giant weight off my shoulders. I've even worked on not being in a rush going everywhere. That probably helps my blood pressure.

Post Career Employment with good benefits,"I currently have a very good, but very big job/career. My husband is older than me an already retired, so I am and have been the primary earner. Our kids are in college without student loans (either already paid or athlete scholarships) and we have a good amount saved (401k + equity in a home that is already way too large for us, and more so once kids are settled). 

I’d like to retire a bit earlier and spend my early years of retirement traveling and enjoying life, but also would like to be employed, to have extra money for fun stuff and to have good insurance. What are your suggestions? Are there companies that provide medical insurance for less than full time workers? Or jobs that might fit the bill?

"What does $350,000 get me in your town for retirement?","Current situation is an attached townhome 1700SF, 3 Bath, 2 Bedroom with attached 2 car garage. Downsides are a poorly managed HOA of which I am treasurer in an impossible situation to improve the things that I don't like. Would also like to turn up the average temp 20 degrees in the winters. 4 seasons are great, just tired of fighting MN winters. Open to 55+ condo, townhome, or SFH. But limited to 350K as I don't want to be ""house poor"" in retirement. Need bike trails in the area and big box stores like WM and Target within 10 miles.

MN has many upsides but I know most of you will never visit the state. The snowbird option may be my solution to the winters (I have an RV). As far as the miserable HOA, my gut tells me they are all horrible. :)

Tired of corporate dysfunction growing as I get closer to retirement,"I like my job but every day I find that dealing with corporate dysfunction is harder and harder. I dread going to work and have a really hard time engaging the way I used to. I just don't care. I'm not crabby at work, in fact just the opposite since I don't take it as seriously as I used to. I'm 62, plan to take SS at 65 and probably have enough to tide me over if I am careful with my spending and maybe pick up some part time work. I'm really curious - have you experienced this? What did you do - retire early, stick it out, something else?

venting about 401k transfers -- spousal consent and increasingly difficult notarization rules,"We're consolidating our various 401k's to streamline management and forecasting. 

RANT ON

I have a modest sized 401k with a former employer that I'm trying to consolidate into another plan. The paperwork is exhausting (\~30 page form); after getting the form completed, they require that my spouse sign and her signature must be notarized.  (not mine -- just hers). Now I learned that there's a new rule that requires additional paperwork from the notary so we have to start the process all over again.

I'm frustrated that they make this so difficult.  I'm annoyed that I have to get my wife's permission to withdraw money that I earned (my wife and I are in lockstep on this but it's still an annoying ""mother may I"" moment). By contrast, I can go withdraw the entirety of my checking or savings accounts without her approval.  

RANT OFF   

Is it my imagination or has it gotten increasingly difficult to make a transfer between 401k's in the last 20-30 years?  I recall doing this in the past -- it basically required a one-page form.

Just Retired- Didn't end as well as I hoped. Anyone else overcome this?,"I had a lot on my plate, and had planned to retire in January. My work changed dramatically over the past 9 months, and it really just felt like too much.   I was also feeling sick and exhausted all the time. Responsibilities for home and family were getting too hard to balance with work.  I realized I didn't need to wait. So I retired a few months earlier than planned. The way it happened wasn't how I planned, although it also wasn't as bad as my head is telling me. I left feeling awkward and sad.

I have friends, family, and lots of interests. I am regaining my energy. I also have some responsibilities for a parent who will need me much more now. But I still have this cloud kind of hanging over me. Not sure if that's a retirement thing or a perfectionist thing. I would love to hear from anyone who has experienced leaving in a not-so-perfect way and found a way to make the best of it.

I know in time this feeling will fade, but I can't help feeling a bit of defeat. Anyone else experience this? What did you do?

Can I roll over an old 401K into an self-managed IRA without paying taxes at time of this late roll-over?,"Thank you everyone.  I am going to look into Fidelity, my dh has money invested with them and speaks highly of them.  He doesn't have an IRA so I didn't know that had that option.  I am going to check them out and I'll let whoever I go with arrange to move both of my 401k's into one IRA (my smaller 401K from last employer is doing well, but it would be nice to have everything in one place).

\- - - - - - - - - 

I have a decent 401K from a job I left 6 years ago.  I left the money there because it was doing really well.  Well, now it's not.  It lost money as market took a nose-dive last year.  It still isn't doing well.  I moved the money into a 'savings' option, but it isn't earning any interest - which is ridiculous with today's interest rates.

Can you roll a 401K over to a self-managed IRA without a tax penalty at the time of a late roll-over?

Who would have an honest answer that I could trust (the institution selling the IRA, or ???)?

DH and I are currently retired on SS which is enough for us to live on, we don't plan on touching the money for awhile..."
Why is it everyone's wish to travel in retirement?,"Admittedly, I'm over simplifying. But it's seems like ""travel and retirement"" go together like ""love and marriage"". 

Is it that people didn't get a chance to travel when they were younger?  Is it a need to tick off something off the bucket list?  Is it something to do so you don't get bored?  Is it that once you travel, you have the itch to travel more? Is it seeing friends post pics of their travels on social media? (I think ""no"" to this one because travel and retirement has been a thing since before social media)

I touist-traveled a fair amount in my younger days, and didn't get married until my mid-30's. When you see those bucket lists on social media, I often hit 80% or more of the things. I've been to all but maybe 7 states (and I'm not taking about just landing in the airport for a layover). 

So when people talk about retirement and expenses, the cost of travel is always part of the conversation. 

But I feel like I probably have less than a dozen places that I still want to see.  And if I don't get there, NBD. So in that sense, I don't think having to factor that in to my expenses or budget is a top priority. 

Why is travel a ""goal"" or ""wish"" for you?"

Lifestyle post: working part time and adapting,"I worked part time when I was in high school. Then in college. There was nothing weird then about not working Tuesday and Wednesday and then working Thursday. 

Then I worked full time for four and a half decades.

Is retirement going to be boring after a while?,"I will be eligible for early retirement in a few months. I am worried that if I pull the trigger on my work and resign, I will just get bored after a while once the excitement of finally retiring has faded in a few months or few years.

With no mortgage and my wife already retired for almost 2 years now, full retirement seems to be the next phase for me. Kids are grown up and fully employed so no issues there.

However I just came back from international travel on holidays and after 3 weeks I had enough already and wanted to go home. There appears to be a natural limit to how much we can enjoy a good thing such as travel and holidays. After a while, what was exciting and enjoyable becomes routine. I thought when retirement comes, I can just enjoy endless vacation and travel but it’s not looking like that. I think psychologist call this as hedonic adaptation.

I am worried that retirement might be the same thing, that after a while I will just get bored with it and yearn for something to do. I can of course develop some new hobbies to keep me occupied in retirement but I am not sure if that will be enough to keep me satisfied. I had a love/hate relationship with work (tech industry) which makes it not an easy decision as I would hope. Being in the cutting edge of tech, it is mentally stimulating and enjoyable. However having to meet all the KPIs all the time is the downside in working. 

Not sure if the above make sense but any insights will be appreciated."
Euro-denominated investments in a US 401K or Sep-IRA,"Forum,

I am a US citizen, preparing to retire full-time to Europe.  One of my concerns is exposure to currency exchange (US to Euro).  Does anyone know if it possible to hold Euro denominated investments, rather than in USD?  If it is possible, I could convert my USD investments to Euro investments when the exchange rates are to my liking.  Then, my future mandatory withdrawals and/or my projected 4% withdrawals from my 401K and Sep-IRA would already be in Euro eliminating my currency exchange exposure.

Inherited IRA Question Re: Pre-2019 Death,"Hey folks!

I plan to call my financial institution to ask and confirm everything I'm about to mention, but was hoping someone with this type of knowledge could confirm that I have this right:

I am a non-spouse beneficiary of two inherited accounts, an IRA and a Roth.

The **decedent passed in 2016** (so, 10 year rule doesn't appear to apply) and I've had these accounts since then.

I have been taking RMDs since I've inherited the accounts, based on my life expectancy.

I'm slowly approaching the 10 year rule I've been hearing about, which is spurring me on to look into this a bit further and make sure it does not apply to me.

I assume my RMDs will increase with MY age and reduce the account balance, but in theory, I could have these accounts for my lifetime? My RMD is currently 10% of the balances, I'm not sure how quickly they go up with my age.

Really appreciate the help, it's not the most fun stuff to dig back into. :)"

Considerations to retire early at 61 or should I keep grinding away?,"61YO next April.  In the U.S.  $1M retirement accounts, $250K non-retirement cash.

I have a high stress job, around 70 to 80 hours weekly and every day—including weekends—is a new crisis, $280K annually.  No mortgage, no debt, live in Florida but in a beachfront condo with a $1K maintenance fee and about $10K annually for insurance and tax.  Daily commute is through hard traffic at 1+ hour total. Had a prostatectomy but will likely need (expensive) radiation at some point in the next 3 to 8 years.  Had skin cancer issues the last few years (melanoma, squamous) and will likely continue to have skin cancer issues, but it hasn’t yet spread.  I’m guessing that skin cancer will take me out at some point. 


Hate my job, which is taking my soul, and it feels like all I do is work, but worried about health insurance.  Don’t want to run out of retirement money (could live on $70K annually in today’s dollars) and also don’t want to leave my partner without anything in their later years, but thinking cancer will get the better of me sooner than later.  Life calculators put me at mid-70s and my partner in their late 80s.

We are currently paying way too much for a family plan with the GIC in Massachusetts.  My school district only pays 50%, so we pay over $14,100 a year.

We are currently strongly leaning towards retiring in Portugal.  Before then, in the U.S. I have to assume that we will both need to sign up for Medicare when we turn 65.   If we decide that we want to move back to the U.S., or even want to visit for a few months, would we be better off continuing to pay for some of the Medicare  plans?  

In Portugal we will be paying for private insurance, but will also have access to the public medical system once we obtain a residency permit.   We have visited the past two summers to suss it out, and believe we will be happy there.  What if we are not?

"Scared about this part of the journey - were you, too?","Edited to add:

Thank you for all the thoughtful, kind replies.

I 'have' to retire, because while I'd planned to wait 4 more years 'til age 70, I was at the same time trying to figure out if my burnout symptoms were just burnout, depression, or cognitive decline. During the past 10 years mentioned in my initial post, I also was a distance caregiver, and with my older sister, traveled to her to be a caregiver multiple times, all while maintaining a full course load and multiple related activities.

I never did figure out the source of my 'crash,' but after meeting with several counselors, did decide 'enough' - just cannot handle it all, you know? And it is with joy that I release the multiple committees and grading and so much more.

I am working to ensure that I will be involved in things I care deeply about. I teach at a library school, and my focus is in medical librarianship - I was a hospital librarian for years. Now I'm on a startup national planning group (several, in fact) supporting rural public libraries, a telehealth group, and am just beginning to engage in research on AI/Chatbots, with a colleague/mentee. I am interested, too, in our growing population of older people, and particularly, in family caregiving. I will probably teach one course per semester (the medical library courses).

===============================================================================

This is my first post here, and hello! I am 66, a professor with retirement pending - officially, it's January 15, but since the school closes after grading deadlines Dec. 15, I'm considering that my retirement date. My husband still has 4 years to go before his own.

The thing is, I'm scared. I have such mixed feelings - I've been working since I was 12, and am not sure who I am without that work identity. I love my job, am motivated, rewarded - but on the flip side, I am burnt out (since COVID, with so many students struggling), and in the past 10 years, all but one of my immediate family has died, including my only child.

I recognized that I need to take care of me, that I'd reached some kind of limit in my ability to absorb loss while continuing to do everything. Counseling has helped with that, somewhat. I do plan to keep active in my research, perhaps seeking another degree, writing, and ... you know, those projects begun and never finished. Meanwhile the countdown feels like facing an oncoming train - 76 days today, 75 tomorrow.

When I've told people I am retiring, they congratulate me, but do not understand how frightening this major change is to me. I know, I know - soon I'll be looking back at this. And some time after that, I will have found new interests.

How do you get through this, anyone? Did you deal with this process with unequivocal eagerness, with a sense of mourning, with a 'hell, yes!' - and did you roller-coaster with all that and more? Was it like moving to a new town for you, where one day, you realize that you didn't have to consciously process your way to the store, but found your way from habit?

There's more I'd love to talk about, including the very different perspectives my husband and I have on this change. Thanks for reading, if you got this far."
Questions I have about Social Security and Medicare,"I (M66) reach FRA early 2024 at 66 1/2.  I own my home and car, have some savings and investments, 401k, and a small pension.  Simple 'back of the cocktail napkin' arithmetic leads me to believe I can afford to retire and continue living (frugally) in my present home.

There are two loose ends I want to understand better.

1. I was married in 1984, divorced 2012.  I'm told I can collect a Social Security benefit from my ex-spouse's entitlement in addition to my own, without affecting her benefits.  I've done a (very) little googling on this and can't seem to find anything that makes me believe this is certainly true.  Is this true?  Is there any down-side to doing this?
2. Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and 'Medicare Replacement' insurances.  Every day my mailbox is stuffed with invitations to 'Retirement Seminars' sponsored by insurance companies and/or financial advisors.  I suspect these free lunch events would be much like timeshare presentations where I'd be held hostage for a few hours long sales pitch.  I'm not particularly interested in financial advice, but would like some guidance choosing health insurance.  Are there any un-biased resources not sourced by the company trying to sell their plan?  How to choose . . . ?"

Taking Social Security early or waiting until FRA ?,"Hi

I originally posted part of this on r/socialsecurity and u/Mid_AM suggested I post it here, too.

I’m interested to hear from people who’ve taken their SS early vs full retirement age. Happy you did ?…any regrets  ?

I'm single (64), no kids, not working, no mortgage, just collecting one pension. I have another very small pension I'll start collecting one day. Also have a couple of 401ks that I haven't touched yet, plus savings.

I did a rough calculation of taking SS now, 64,  vs at FRA of 66 yrs 10 months. By the time I reach age 80 I will have collected approximately the same, give or take, if I start now or FRA.

It's after 80 that the FRA is a bonus. If I lived until 90 I will have collected approx $82K more than if I collect at 64.

It is all a gamble of how long you think you'll live and how healthy you expect to be. Also, the thought of what happens if SS runs out of money or gets reduced like some people predict...then the earlier the better.

You all can Google for predictions of what may happen with Social Security – no changes, reduction by a certain percent, or it will no longer be funded.

Ack! Part-time job offering me medical insurance! NOW what do I do?,"I'm recently retired and being 67, took advantage of ""special enrollment period"" status to get Medicare A, B, D, G insurance (not Medicare Advantage), which has all now kicked in. So these are all respective ""primary payers"" for what they cover. I am not taking Social Security yet, even though I'm Full Retirement Age, electing to wait until it maxes out at 70. Instead, we're living off savings, my wife's Social Security, which is small enough we're in a basement tax bracket for the next 3 years. Since I can work a little without compromising the tax status, I've taken a part time job at a big box store. (Fun, plus gets me off my butt.) Much to my surprise, they offer enrollment in health insurance coverage to *part-time employees*, not just full-time employees. 

But I don't want to screw things up with those Medicare and Supplement plans being the primary payer. The last thing I want to have happen is they become secondary payer, and then I quit the part time job, and now I'm the primary payer.

Thoughts of pets during retirement,"Come home after doing some errands. The recliner I settle into responds with a distinct, creak. Next to me is a tall glass of water and remote control. Then it comes. Shiny black hindquarters appear on the armrest. A steady motor sound gets louder. It gingerly steps onto my lap and flops. It comforts me.

Next morning I emerge from the bedroom. A scamper and two hopeful wide eyes. We walk side by side down a dim hall. My naked legs tingle from softness below.

Later in the day there’s a knock at the door and rumble of a truck. I slowly get up and head for the stairs. I take two steps down and a flash of white and black dashes and cuts in front. I wobble and curse the day I got a cat.

I really like my cats. However on the other hand they make travel more difficult, I endure struggles carrying Large quantities of their things, and there is near fatal tripping on rare occasions. Yes the stair story has repeated itself more than once. It is scary. I move much slower now.

Are you living with the long lived pet that stayed as the kids grew up and moved on? Did you imagine that occurring or did it just happen? Will they be the last? Or are you just now seeking that Companionship, a built in listener, way to nurture, and amusement from random behavior .. wrapped in one creature? "
Help with Income Tax for First Year of Retirement,"I retired on February 1, so 2023 will be my first year filing federal, state, and local income tax as a retiree.  Although I have always done my own taxes, I think I  should find a service that focuses on retirees to do my taxes this time.  I want to be sure they are done right.  Once I have see how a professional does it, I might opt to resume filing them myself subsequently, or not.  I am looking for your thoughts on this, and recommendations on tax services. Thanks."
A Selection of Non-Financial Retirement Books (and a blog),"There are tons and tons of retirement books that talk about finances to the point that one might start thinking that money is the only component of entering and living the retired life.

I've been retired a few years but in the years immediately before retiring I found these *non-finance* retirement books to be of use:

1. “Preparing to Make the Most of Your Free Time After Retirement” by Bob Lowry
2. ""Preparing For Your Active Life After Retirement: A Guide to The Most Exciting Journey of Your Life, The One That Takes Place After Retirement” by Bob Lowry
3. “How to Retire Happy, Wild, and Free” by Ernie J. Zelinski
4. “Retirement: A Memoir And Guide” by Boyd Lemon
5. ""“Living A Satisfying Retirement” by Bob Lowry

And I'm happy to see that Bob Lowry has started updating his blog again, which is full of good advice in the posts *and in the comments*:  [My Satisfying Retirement](https://satisfyingretirement.blogspot.com)."
"For those considering retirement (or already/newly retired) check out the book, 'How To Retire Happy, Wild And Free'!","We were looking at retiring a little earlier than initially planned and spent a good deal of time (about a year) really deep diving into everything especially financial and healthcare related. It was daunting and scary to say the least. But one thing we really didn't think all that much about was the **lifestyle change** that would occur. All that time off and what to do. Then I picked up the book, 'How To Retire Happy, Wild And Free' but Ernie Zelinski. The subtitle is 'Retirement Wisdom That You Won't Get From Your Financial Advisor'. It was an eye opener and a game changer for us. Especially my wife. She was the more cautious and pessimistic about retiring early but after reading that she did an enthusiastic 180 and was onboard. We retired at the end of 2021 (60-me, 59-her) and we absolutely love it. There are a lot of considerations about what exactly you will want and be able to do in retirement that a lot of people don't think about until they retire and then they find they really aren't prepared for the lifestyle change. Has anyone else out there read this excellent book? If so, was it as eye-opening for you as it was for us?"
Advice for those that are healthy / fit and like physical activities,"Try and get younger friends.  
  
I have seen it all too often, my mom was very active but all her friends died 5-10 years before her leaving her with no one to do anything with.

We often went on bike rides together even when a few friends were still alive, but went into assisted living type situations.   Many seniors just aren't healthy enough to go on even a 10 mile bike ride."
Schwab called and said they messed up on a conversion,"Hi all, just got a call this morning from a transaction couple of weeks ago. I created a new traditional IRA account on schwab, then converted it into a roth IRA for the limit gross. However, schwab’s rep who assisted just called and they said made a mistake, and withheld the taxes which was almost half the amount of the conversion. 
So now I have a negative balance on the traditional ira and not sure what to do.

Would love to get your advice on anything I can do!"
"For those of you that have one, what is your downsizing strategy in (or in preparation for) retirement?","Not everyone has a plan to downsize. But we were struck by friends dealing with aging parents who were now facing a necessary and also very abrupt transition. Some had decided to stay in the same 5 BR house they had lived in for 40 years and raised a family in, and it was filled with collectibles, memorabilia and decades worth of stuff, but were finding it impossible to maintain. Some had retired to a new build out on 15 acres in the country, with a quarter-mile driveway and a 30 minute drive to a grocery store or a doctor's office or a Target, and a brush hog in the out-building. While well-meaning, this often ended in an awful stage where they had to give up practically everything and move into assisted living. We swore we would not follow the same path.

For us, this meant emptying a house that was too big by half of furniture and lots of things we just didn't need anymore, and starting to look to downsize. We had the pleasure of selling the house before buying the next one and living in a 2-BR apartment for six months with most of our remaining stuff in storage; this taught us that such a lifestyle was not only doable but downright pleasant. We're now in our downsized and last house, all paid off. But we know that we won't be here for two decades. We fully plan to continue shedding stuff until we can move into a 2-BR apartment or condo. We'll keep a car but may not need it as much if we're on public transport routes. The location will need to be within a walk or ride to key services like groceries or pharmacy or restaurant district. We want to manage the shrinking of our material footprint by ourselves, without being pushed into it in crisis mode.

What about your plans if you have one? How is it working for you?"
Any 60+ retirees raising their grandkids? How are you managing?,I'm 62 and my wife is 57 and have been raising my grandson since he was 18 months.  He's now 3 1/2 and I plan to retire next May when I turn 63. We tried to transition him to his mom (my daughter) and her husband (who is not the father) and it was a total failure. The transition was poorly planned both by us and my daughter.  My daughter tried her best but my grandson could not adapt fast enough for my son in law.  Now he's back with us after only 10 weeks and spewing all kinds of terrible things (at least IMO) he heard from living with them.  How are you managing it?  Do you have outside help?.  Any advice?
"Acquaintance dropped dead unexpectedly, partner never got to enjoy retirement with them.","Just as title says, sad outcome. Passing was totally unexpected. Kids are very young adults and very close to the parent who passed.
Person who passed was in their early 60s, just retired a year ago.

Waiting on partner, a couple years older, to retire next year so that they could begin the fun of traveling, doing home projects, visiting their kids and their own siblings, and taking up some hobbies they were super excited to do together.

"Tired, just tired - how do you recover? - padding to make minimum","No, NOT medical (been tested)

I still try and hit the gym 3 days/week.  In the shape I was 2+ years ago, I could never have done it (I'm still overweight, but dropped 140 lbs, and have worked out 5+ days/week for the couple of years  
How do you guys deal with just being REALLY tired?  I've used a few of the off days to just chill, but it seems to make things worse."
Our adult son may be living with us in retirement,"When my son was in high school, we all had big plans for him: college, a career and most importantly - independence. College was a bust, and now he’s living with us. He turns 25 next month. I’ve tried persuading him to learn a trade like carpentry, HVAC, welding, electrician, mechanic - he has lots of great options. But he’s completely satisfied with working for $17 an hour. What’s more concerning is that my wife wants to let him stay here rent-free indefinitely, and doesn’t like when I pressure him to move on to a job that will help him become independent.

I’m retiring in 2 years (wife is already retired), and I’m trying to figure out my plan. I like my son, but he’s out all hours and comes home at 5 am. His total lack of ambition is a problem for me. He doesn’t have the same fear of poverty I did when I was 25. He doesn’t want to move in with roommates, saying “I don’t want to have to trust another person”. I had random roommates until I married my wife at 32, some good, and some bad. It just wasn’t an option to live alone until my salary caught up and allowed me to buy a house.

Just wondering what others’ experiences have been here. My son says things like “multi-generational households are the new norm”. But I want my retirement days to be quiet - I want that empty nest.

EDIT:

I appreciate every comment, and I want to address some of them. My son does have ADHD, and he struggled in school. He smokes marijuana, but he’s cut back after seeing me quit drinking almost a year ago. I can see the difference. He has something called Klinefelters syndrome, so he can’t have kids. He’s gay, but the one boyfriend he had was a long distance relationship - he prefers not to be in a relationship. He does suffer from depression (untreated), and I think that’s why my wife is so easy on him.

He sometimes spends money on stupid things (like DoorDash), but when he goes out it’s usually to his friends’ houses to watch TV and hang out. He doesn’t go to concerts or bars.

My game plan right now it to talk to my wife and come up a 2-year deadline. During that 2 years, I want to see some progress toward learning a trade. I’m going to start being annoying about it, bringing it up weekly. After 2 years, he’ll start paying rent - $800 including utilities. The money will go into a savings account for him to access when he moves out."
"Retirees: what are you surprised you are NOT doing, even though you have the time to do it?","For me, I thought I’d spend a month catching up on TV shows I’ve started but not completed.

Considering New Job with State Pension at Age 49,"I recently applied and interviewed for a state job that has a pension. I have not yet been offered the job, but I'm considering my options. I was one of three people selected for the final interview.

What are your thoughts on starting a job with a pension later in life?

I am 49 years old. I have worked mostly in jobs with defined contribution plans like 401k and 457b in my career. I have built a decent nest egg until now. I calculated that I would get around 25% of my final salary with a pension at age 65 if I worked for 16 years. I could retire early from the state with the pension at age 62 for a reduced benefit in 13 years. The pension comes with COLA, spouse survivor benefits, and health benefits for retirees. I could also buy 5 years of service at retirement. I would also still be contributing to Social Security too. "

A Major Cardiac Event Changed My Outlook In Retirement. Would You Share How Your Serious Illness Transformed Your Perspective In Retirement?,"(**TLDR**: 3 Min Read. This essay describes how I transformed my philosophy and gained a unique therapeutic perspective on my relationship to myself, friends, family, and life.)

The chest pain (angina) was like a Mike Tyson left hook; it stopped me during a tennis match. My widow maker artery, which supplies nearly one-half of oxygenated blood to my heart, was ninety-five percent blocked. In that condition, death is generally the first symptom when a heart attack happens.

Once I got to the emergency room, the nurse asked me if I was in pain. No, I responded. She hooked me up to an EKG, measured blood pressure, gave me aspirin, and took blood to check for troponin levels, a biomarker for a heart damage.

Within hours, I was admitted to the hospital. Thirty-six hours later, I had a coronary angioplasty procedure, but a tear in an artery required a hospital stay tethered to a heparin intravenous drip for days. The uncertainty was unsettling and tested my fortitude.

Today, I have good heart function thanks to a few stents. The confounding aspect of my health crisis was how I was oblivious to the gradual decline of my cardiovascular and pulmonary function. At sixty-eight, I erroneously attributed the fatique and shortness of breath to poor sleep and aging.

Beyond my hero’s journey from disease to health, I recognize the indelible connection between contentment and living in the present moment. Like tangled fishing line, the EKG, oxygen, and intravenous wires demanded my attention to it.

For most of my life, I walked around with an invisible mist of anxiety. The malaise was a need to know what would happen next. Will it rain at the baseball game tonight? What calamity at the airport will ruin my vacation? I focused on many things, rarely the present moment.

My cardiac event, an inflection point, was a palate cleanser for distracting thoughts. It’s almost impossible to ruminate about anything when the cardiologist tells you that your clogged arteries are worrisome. To cope with the upsetting news, I focused on micro-moments, what I was doing, minute to minute.

As Ram Das, the famous spiritualist, wrote, “Be Here Now.” Making the hospital bed, walking to get coffee near the nurse’s station, or talking to my friends kept me in the here and now. One of my favorite times was seeing the sunrise from my hospital window. Sleeping at home without the hum and clacking of the hospital radiator was sublime.

I lost my taste for repressed feelings and stuffed emotions, giving way to a preference for the full human buffet - joy, sadness, curiosity, infatuation, frustration, excitement, gratitude, etc. We cannot selectively numb our emotions without inadvertently desensitizing the whole person, according to author Brene Brown.

A good friend visited me at the hospital and I couldn’t suppress the lump in my throat upon seeing him. Momentary self-pity and melancholy led to tears. While it is rare for most men to cry in front of another, the emotional release was freeing. Afterwards, I felt cleansed.

What’s more, like taking off a heavy backpack, I unloaded the weight of pretense, cynicism, and expectations. Why invest any malicious energy gossiping about another’s mate selection or career path or abrasive personality? I turned down the volume of negative self-talk, too.

Getting stuck in traffic is okay. Stubbing my toe hurts, but I don't need to berate myself anymore. Being in a one-way conversation with a self-interested individual is nothing to get upset about.

Ultimately, my ten day hospital stay taught me to face daily life without numbing or taking the edge off with alcohol, Benadryl to aid my sleep, or fat-laden foods to satisfy emotional eating. Simultaneously, love, compassion, and courage emerge. Forgiveness abounds, especially to myself. Materialism takes a back seat; less is more.

This existential orientation requires different muscles. With these shifts in perspective and temperament, the best way to explain my transformation is the meme: “If You Know, You know.""

So, with a refurbished heart and a new lens on life, I sit comfortably at my desk with my feet planted on the floor. I sip coffee, write, and test-drive my new vulnerability.

Even food tastes better as I slow down and savor the subtle layers of salt, sweet, savory, and spice. Yesterday, I couldn’t stop my heartfelt tears as I watched the movie, The Bachelors, about a widower and his son reconciling their grief and embarking on romantic relationships. 

The electronic-inspired classical tunes of Japanese composer Toshifumi Hinata play softly in the background. I feel my chest inflate with life-giving oxygen. Bolstered with free flowing coronary arteries, my disposition is like a puppy’s wagging tail - innocent, curious, and welcoming of everything.

Retirees: How do your weekends differ from your weekdays?,"Do all seven days kind of run together now?

Do you just do whatever you feel like each day? Over perhaps avoid going out on weekends and the crowds?

Do you still have set things that define a weekend, for instance going to church on Sunday?

Are you now much more indifferent to weekends?

Just curious!"
My need for the outdoors - should I move?,"I've been reading this thread, about what to do in retirement and didn't want to post this, there.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/16p2bcm/being\_retired\_is\_a\_big\_life\_change\_and\_i\_am/](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/16p2bcm/being_retired_is_a_big_life_change_and_i_am/)

Seems everyone loves the outdoors, but I am extreme.  I'm basically an introvert that could spend his day staring at leaves or whatever.  I've always tried to arrange my life to have access to nice places where I can enjoy peace and solitude.

Also, ***I like living in places of low population density.***

Ten or so years ago brought us to suburbia.  Now my wife and I are retired.  Those places that I crave are no longer near enough for me.  It takes an outing to get there.  I want them close enough to get to by foot, bike, or short (very short) car ride.

I want to move.  If I threw a fit my wife would agree to move.  Moving would be a major hassle and I hate to put her, and me through it - but dang.  I went camping last week and didn't want to come home.  I know the answer to my question but - should I move?  We are both late 60's and in fairly good health.  We're not rich but we can afford retirement.  We own our house and cars.  Dang I miss not being able to drive to the woods after supper for a quick hike, fish, or hunt and be back by dark.

The downside is, we now live in a world of convenience.  Moving away from that would be a big hassle at out age.  Shopping, gyms, healthcare, and stuff like that are a hop, skip, and a jump away.  I know what it's like to spend half a day or more getting to a doctor or dentist appointment.   Or to drive 45 minutes each way to grocery shop.

"Many of my retired friends have become functioning alcoholics. I wish this was hyperbole, but it's not.","They all live in different states and have this in common. My husband and I used to party a bit when we were younger with these people but we've grown out of it. Sure we like an occasional dinner out and a drink (or two if we're feeling crazy) but nothing like what we're experiencing with our friends. Day drinking, alcohol tastings, tours...all geared toward alcohol. What's the deal?"
How to retire from a job you created but grew to be too important to quit?,"I (mid 60s age) developed something during my career that really took off and is used everywhere. Think of that XKCD comic (see here [https://xkcd.com/2347/](https://xkcd.com/2347/) ) I'm that guy. I made no money directly off of it, but it made my career and via opportunities it drew to me, it made me fairly wealthy. Money is not the problem.

Now the problem: I have a sort of second career I've always wanted to do (writing) and dabbling in it once, I wrote a best seller in it's niche. The problem is, see the comic above. Not only am I known for this thing, it's important to countless people, it indirectly helped even sell my book, but at the same time, it's a bit of an albatross around my neck. What if you created your own job, set your own terms but it won't let you retire from it? Now, I'm a better creator than a manager.  People have launched businesses off of my stuff, I don't mind, that's what I did it for -- but a decent manager could have easily replaced themselves long ago and made that business pay. I'm still the kingpin and driver of it, I've had help, but no one to really stand in my place. 

Sort of a first-world problem, and if there is a divine, I appreciate the irony of it all, but if any of y'all have some insights on this probably arcane situation, let me know."
Being retired is a big life change and I am struggling a bit.,"I have only been retired for a few months and many of my friends are still working so I don't really feel like I can complain about my life to them.  I am hoping for advice or a supportive pep talk. 

After working 40 years in a job that was very consuming I have retired and I am having a difficult time.  At the beginning I was up every day to hit the gym, now I am skipping the gym and saying yes to anything that gets me out of the house.  When I am home I just read or end up wasting time and getting nothing done. I thought this would be my big chance to get some projects done and enjoy my hobbies, but I am getting absolutely nothing accomplished.

I don't feel useful or productive like I did at work. I know that I am supposed to enjoy myself and do whatever I want, but that isn't really working out. 

Did anyone else have trouble hitting their stride in retirement?"
"How long did you keep ""work product"" after retirement?","Just curious:  For those who were, perhaps, a member of a team, who had to prepare documentation on your responsibilities for those team members, on your retirement, so they could do your ""stuff:""  How long did you wait to delete your copies of that documentation?    


I mean, I've been gone for a year, and they haven't called for any help (makes me feel a little unimportant, but I'm okay with that) - so I'm guessing I don't need to keep it any longer.  But, with my luck, they'll call next week if I delete it today.  


How long did you wait before you deleted the traces of your job that you kept ""just in case?"""
"My retirement list (or part of it, at least)","As noted in a comment elsewhere, I spent my first year of retirement largely idle, lazing around watching TV and reading. Very enjoyable after a life of work, but I resolved to do more in my second year  and ongoing. Still not rushing around  but more active.

To encourage this  I made a list of stuff to do. I'm not saying it will all ever be done, but it is there for my inspiration.

1. Buy less processed foods, cook more from scratch. This is going well. I'll always have the odd ready meal in the freezer, for emergencies, but I am cooking more and even baking my own bread. And some of those freezer meals are now home cooked.

-----

2. Get back into BBQ. An old hobby of mine, that faded during COVID. Getting back into it in a big way.

-----

3. Tame the garden. Despite several attempts, I am failing in this one. I am considering getting someone in for the back-breaking work, and then taking it from there.

-----

4. Get back into playing guitar. An amateur musician and songwriter, my guitar playing was interupted in 2020 by problems with my hand and grip. The problem has now gone, and I am out of practice.

-----

5. Go out more, for days and longer holidays, with my dog.

-----

6. Record the ""difficult second album"". In the early 1990s, I recorded a dozen of my own songs, and released them on cassette tape. I have a lot more songs now, have decent recording kit, and CD duplication is cheap. It just needs me to make a start on it.

-----

7. Restart my old astronomy hobby. This I've already started on, both getting out my old, quite-decent, manual telescope, and also buying a new electronic telescope. Unfortunately, nights skies have been terribly cloudy for the last 3 months; I am hoping winter skies will be clearer.

-----

8. Start board-gaming again. Another hobby that COVID interrupted. I am currently converting my conservatory - which was also my games room - back from being a home office.


Your list would be different, but I bet there are things that you used to enjoy, but found yourself with less time for, because of day-to-day life & work. Now's the time to think about such hobbies!"
What would you do if you were in my predicament?,"I retired from a company that had an ESOP/401k wrapped up in company stock. I had about $300,000 total, in the same fund. It grew on average 9% a year in the 15 years I worked there. They gave us dividends on this stock too, totaling about $4,000 a year. I have started a new 401k with my new employer. Should I leave the old one alone, or bring it to my new employer’s 401k since I’m contributing to the new one? My concern is since I’m no longer contributing to the old one, I’ll be missing out on the exponential gains. Transferring it to another fund would fix this problem since the gains will be very slow growing in my new 401k with such a low balance."
How am I doing? Does this sound like doable income for retirement beginning in 2030?,"I'm a 60-year-old social worker who has been worried about retirement my entire career, given that I've never earned any kind of big money that would allow me to make substantial savings.  Thankfully, I do have a state pension and hope Social Security is still with us when I retire!  My SS retirement age is 67, so I've been doing some early planning and trying to figure out how my husband and I will fare after we leave the workforce. (We got married last year; he's worked in manufacturing his entire worklife and I currently outearn him by nearly double, so he's had the same challenge with saving).  As of today, my estimated state pension at age 67 will be about $4000 per month and SS will be about $2800, giving me a personal gross annual income of about $82,000 per year before factoring in any retirement income from my husband's SS or distributions from my IRA. Currently, my Fidelity IRA has a value of $165,000, and based on the current value of my house, I have about $200,000 in equity (now) and will be in Year 17 of a 30-year mortgage in 2030. As an added bonus, my husband and I both anticipate an inheritance from our surviving parents. We have no idea what that will be, of course, but assuming neither live to be 100, I suspect it could be as much as a few hundred thousand dollars.

How does my picture look?  $82K from just my retirement income alone doesn't sound too bad, but that's gross without factoring in taxes.  Any thoughts from y'all?  Thanks!

Edited to correct a typo.

Edit 2: Folks are pointing out that I need to estimate expenses in order to have an idea if this is enough. This is a good point which I need to think about. Our stock monthly expenses aren't bad, about $5000 per month with some variation here and there, but we both have car payments which we hopefully won't have at retirement. Someone also mentioned thinking about what we we t to do with the mortgage. Great food for thought! As you can tell, this is all new to me. Thanks for the input!"
Downsizing or relocating as part of strategy,"Asking for input as I see people talk about doing this in their future, but rarely see posts on how it turned out or people who are doing it now.

Many people will have a significant amount of equity in their primary home when they approach retirement.  Who has downsized and or relocated for retirement?  Did you pocket equity for additional savings, buy 2 smaller homes in 2 locations ( home and a 2nd location)?"
CalPERS retirees: are there Medical Flexible Spending Accounts?,"State of California employees can have some of our income set aside in pre-tax ""Flexible Spending Accounts"" for medical or dependant care expenses.  **For those of you who retired under CalPERS, is a similar option available after retirement?  I can't find any mention in PUB-1.**

If not the same sort of FSA, is there any other way to reduce taxes on minor medical expenses?  We typically do $100/month which covers co-pays, eyeglasses, sunscreen, vitamins, etc.  It saves us 30% at our top marginal rate.

Since my CalPERS pension includes healthcare, I don't believe I'm eligible for a Health Savings Account."
retired but have not transitioned to a relaxed state of mind,I have been retired now for about 4 months and in general am enjoying it. But I still feel self-imposed pressure to pack as much as I can into each day like I always did. I hope that eventually I will transition to a mindset that allows for me to 'waste' time and be at peace with that.  I have had friends tell me it has taken them 6-12 months or longer to truly make this transition.  I wonder what other people on this forum have experienced?
Work Friends after retirement? Do you stay in contact?,"I was wondering if people after they retire stay in contact with people from work and if people that have retired stay in contact with current workers? I am ready to retire first of the year at 63. I have a couple friends I have some contact with text go to lunch once in a great while that have retired in the past couple years. I think the current people I work with I will have very little to no contact with just because I have usually always preferred to keep work live and personal live separate for the most part. I like to leave work and the people as well for the most part. Only maybe 2 or 3 at most will I have contact with and 2 of them have already retired. Anyway, just wondering how it goes with others. Thanks for the feedback in advance."
Inherited IRA question: any issue with taking it in a chunk?,"I inherited a small IRA from my late husband at 40 that has grown to be about $60k.  Besides it being taxed as income, is there anythi g wrong with taking it all in a short amount of time?

I need to fill in the gap from 63 (when one of my two pensions ends) to 67 when SS kicks in. Is there a problem just taking it all in there rather than the magic 4% rule?"
Part time consulting and taxes on Medicare,"Hello, I retired in February and started Medicare/BC.  I was offered a consulting gig for $5k a month for not a lot of time and took it!  Choice is take the money as dividends and pay at that rate or estimate  taxes on wage and Medicare and submit to IRS quarterly.  Kind of irks me to pay into Medicare while getting it.  Advice?"
"For those who loved their jobs, what FIRST made you consider retiring?","I have a friend who is in higher education. She said this year, for the first time, she is forgetting words and terms as she teaches.. things that she knows like the back of her hand.

 In addition, she's feeling more of a disconnect with the students than ever before. They don't get things that she is referencing, and she has trouble understanding some topics they're presenting and discussing, (think, for instance, someone doing an oral presentation on whether Snapchat should be considered  intellectual property... and she has never seen Snapchat!).

Finally every instructor is going to need to utilize an online learning platform for their classes. Even though she teaches face to face, she's going to have to learn and use this complex online teaching platform to supplement her classes.

End result? Now for the first time shemay consider retiring. Like the job, loves it and some respects, but said she does not necessarily want to learn somenthings she needs to in order to do it.

Giving My Notice Went Better Than I Expected,Boss sent an invite for a meeting about the organization of a really large expansion project that I’m managing in addition to managing the plant where it is taking place last week while I was on vacation. I’d planned on giving him my notice (8-9 months) this week anyway. This just set up the conversation perfectly. It’s not ideal timing from his side of the table but he understood my perspective and didn’t freak out. I think he was worried about asking me to go full time managing the entire capital program and divorce myself from day to day operations so this was enough of a change of course to keep him from having to sell me on the idea. He’s come to grips with how aggressive the home office is being with the expansion plans and knows we aren’t staffed for it. I’m looking forward to working my way out of this place over the coming months and enjoying other interests and opportunities after that. This was a real relief for me.
Gah - What is left of the job - things not as planned,"So, back when, I said ""Hey, my boss is offering me a good deal - let me move, work from home 3 days at lower pay, but he pays for my medical""  
Last week (not retired YET), got notice, they didn't pay the medical, and I have no insurance, and doesn't look like it is coming back anytime soon - lack of $$  
Went out, picked up a Bronze level plan for right now, and paying myself.  Looks like I'm not going to bother with him come retirement (8 weeks and counting).  I'll see if I can find a gig when I move, but if I can't, I can't  


Joke:  He's pressuring me to get some stuff done to get more $$ in the door.  Between the being laid off 2days/week, and now lack of medical, I'm in the ""screw it"" mode.  I also am asking for the money they deducted for my share of the medical back.  


53 days till I close on the new house (scheduled) - probably 2-3 weeks after that for the contractors to do their stuff

Good news, they made a payment, retroactive to July 31.
The other good news is I checked my pension for one of the companies I used to work for (was not counting it in my calculations, figured it as ‘extra’ cash. ) $1000/month with 50% survivor for my wife.
I’m feeling a lot better about retirement, as I’ve been living in $4k/month, including mortgage, and with the relocation, the mortgage goes away"
Cohousing community experience - creating one or living in one,"Does anyone live in or has helped to create a cohousing community (ala Beth Baker - With a Little Help from Our Friends)? We are very interested in living in one or creating one with our closest friends, but need some guidance as to where and how to start - including acquiring the property, building planning, and ongoing governance, etc.. Obviously, finding an established community is easiest, but wanted to reach out to the r/retirement mind to see what you already know! TYIA!"
Wait a few months to take FRA or take it now?,"Debating if I should take my Social Security Retirement now at 66 years and 2 months, or wait until I am 66 years and 6 months. Any advice appreciated:

Monthly benefit at FRA (66 years and 6 months): $962.

Monthly benefit four months earlier right now (66 years and 2 months): $941.

Difference in monthly benefits: $962 - $941 = $21

$3,764 (additional benefits by claiming four months earlier) / $21 (extra per month) = approximately 179.24 months. So, it would take approximately 179.24 months to break even, or nearly 15 years, in terms of total benefits received.

Financially, my spouse is getting too told to work, and already started their retirement a while back. So now neither of us would be working, and we would not really having any other income like a 401k (immigrants with some bad planning advice given to us early on).

LTC Long Term Care - Genworth Settlement Offers - opinions and feedback,"\*Posting on behalf of my 76 year old father and 74 year old mother, as I see a lot of interaction on LTC questions in this sub.

My parents have LTC insurance with Genworth Financial and have a policy covered in the recent Haney, et al. v. Genworth settlement. Obviously, it's in Genworth's best interested to get as many of these policies off their books as they can, so we're trying to navigate the best option for my parents. [Linked is the image of the options on the table for them now](https://ibb.co/7RJK38j). The image linked is for one of them and the other's coverage is around the same. 

The current policy includes a monthly benefit of $6,945 with a lifetime benefit of $250,020. Premium increases are frozen for another 18+ months or so before the expected 20% annual increases and the benefit doesn't kick in for three months for in-home care and six months for nursing home/etc. base housing/care.

LTC and end of life care financial planning isn't something I have any experience with, so where better to turn that Reddit.

They are in very good health, consistent exercise, great diet and live an active lifestyle. Net worth just north of $1MM, which is higher that it was when they retired 17 years ago. They come from a bygone personal financial era of pensions, so their monthly cash flow includes private and public pensions and annuities for life. They were fortunate enough to wait until they were forced to draw on their private retirement accounts. 

Another key component is that their home state enforces a 20% annual premium increase cap, which we can all assume will be maxed out every year until the end of time.

Given their healthy lifestyle, little family history of disease and the benefit not kicking in for six months for care in a facility, I'm torn on what to recommend.

Does anyone have any experience or thoughts on the matter?"
SAHM and retirement planning and saving -- disconnect?,"Cross-posted from r/personalfinance.

 

I  (62F) see a lot of posts here as people struggle to figure out if they  can afford to stay at home with the kids. I am also recently retired and  subscribe to various retirement subreddits and Facebook groups. Some  posts there are heartbreaking: A woman in her 50's loses her husband to  death or divorce and suddenly finds herself impoverished as she  approaches what were supposed to be the golden years.

It  feels like a disconnect. Perhaps I erred on the side of caution perhaps  brought on by poverty in my youth, but throughout my working career I  had my eye on retirement and I guarded that incredibly closely; for  example, in my divorce I gave up the house and the car so that I could  keep my retirement intact.

For the  stay-at-home parents out there: Is retirement and social security  entering your computations? Maybe this post is really a pleading one,  especially for women, to please look at what your years outside the  workforce will do to your eventual retirement savings. Being on this  side of the equation and recently retired, it can be huge.

It  would be great if our country (US) did a better job with child care and  also addressing stay-at-home parents' retirement accounts, but we're  sure not there yet."
Husband/wife age difference…any “gotchas”?,"I am 58 and my husband is 52.  What are some things regarding retirement that we should take into account due to the age difference?  

I will likely retire in about 5 years, but he will still be working for at least another 5 years after I retire.

I have 2 pensions, a healthy 403(b), a Roth, a little  $ in a TSA, all through my employer.
Husband has just a Roth  less than half what I have, through his work (he moved here from another country so got a late start).

I know there is always the option to pad the nest egg by continuing to work until he retires, but I’m interested in things I should know … any “gotchas” with retiring before he does.

Thanks."
No arts & crafts classes anymore where I live,"There used to be lots of classes available at the community college but I think COVID or maybe social media killed them all, or else the college decided personal enrichment was no good anymore. In my 20s I took pottery, basketry, jewelry-making, flower arranging and I was a model for figure drawing and sculpture. In my 30s I took fiddle and career/personality testing classes. There used to be ukulele, guitar and mandolin. There were dozens of cooking classes. There were lectures which were always full of woo-woo topics but also full of people. The university had adventure trips and climbing wall plus pottery and some other things. Now that I am retired and have all this time there is almost nothing. I guess I am just complaining but man I am feeling kind of cheated. I have some friends to play fiddle with 3x a week, I work in a Japanese garden 2x a week (it beats me up it's such hard work) and I walk around a lot but I'd like to learn something new and do crafts with other people in a space where I can make a mess. Meetup didn't have anything interesting. I really really wanted to try the basketry again.

What the hell happened? There are more retirees than ever but nobody wants to do anything?"
Update: Involuntary Retired Today - The Next Phase,"Greetings r/retirement! As the title says, this is an update post.

One month ago I was let go from a job I’d held for more than 25 years. I posted to this sub while sipping a glass of 18-year old  Macallan scotch.

I’m at that age where finding another position in my field can be next to impossible, and a lot of folks in my situation choose to retire. And I was fully prepared to do the same.

After a lot of support and advice from this sub and a lot of reflection, I’ve landed another position in my field and I start work Monday. I found a smaller organization that was genuinely open an older worker and the experience I can bring to the table. And I’m excited by the professional opportunity, there’s a lot I can contribute. 

The pay is considerably less than my previous job, but I’m OK with that. All of the financial calculations I’ve tested say that my current retirement portfolio has a >95% chance of lasting at least 30 years. The new job will allow me to continue my current lifestyle, I just won’t be saving anywhere near what I had been for the past 5-7 years.

So thank you all for your support and advice. I really appreciate it. CHEERS!"
"Am 50 and still working. Got an offer for LTC. What is your opinion, as a retired person.","My employer is offering $400,000 for a whole life policy with LTC rider.  I would pay $280 a month from now until death.

I am concerned that if I use the policy in 70’s that $400k would not be enough.

Would I be better off saving the money myself from now until 70-75 in case I need LTC?"
Monthly Budget in Retirement - Comparison to Pre-Retirement,"My husband and I are about 8 years from our intended retirement dates, so we are starting to look at more of the details to make sure we are on track.  One of the things that we are doing is making preliminary budget based on our likely monthly expenses, etc.  to see how that looks - and how it compares to our current expenses.   

I'm looking for feedback from those who have retired about how your monthly expenses in retirement compare to pre-retirement.  What went down, what went up.  

I want to make sure I am being realistic in our planning rather than just assume a percentage decrease based on a rule of thumb.  Like, obviously once we retire, we will no longer be saving up for retirement, so that's a big expense that goes away.  But most of our living expenses won't change.  We'll probably scale back to one car at some point, so there will be decreased expenses there.  But on the other hand, we'll have more time for travel and other hobbies, so those expenses will go up.  I figure that our health insurance and costs will also increase as we get older and we have more stuff wrong with us.

Does anybody have suggestions for free retirement planning tools?,"I am in my early 50's and starting some initial planning for retirement, potentially in my late 50's. So far I've used i-ORP.com, FIRECalc.com, and recently tried IncomeWize.com. All of them are good but do have their pros and cons. Can anybody suggest other free retirement planning tools?  I would like to test out as many as I can before picking one as a primary tool.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I didn't realize there were so many tools out there. The Wiki was an excellent resource which I now have bookmarked.  
  
I thought I’d report back on what I decided. After spending a few days looking at a number of the tools, I found many of the free tools to be somewhat simplistic. I eventually settled on IncomeWize.com. It doesn't have everything I'd like, for example, backtesting (PortfolioVisualizer.com), but it does have Monte Carlo stress testing.  
  
Overall the tax component made the difference for me. Most of the tools I looked at didn't have detailed taxes and features to help reduce taxes, which is important to me. Also, it calculates SS and pension survivor benefits, IRMAA surcharges, etc. which is important. I plan to work part time for the first few years in retirement and the fact that penalties are calculated for working while taking Social Security benefits might be helpful.  
  
Anyhow, I'm also planning on using a backup tool like NewRetirement.com for the year before and after retirement to make sure everything looks as expected.  
  
Thanks to everybody for the suggestions and information.

New Credit Card Post Retirement?? When applying for a new card what do you use for your income? AGI?,"Planning to retire at the end of the year, will be getting some travel cards, can I wait until I need them or should I apply now."
What do you say when you reach retirement (or semi) and people ask you what you are planning for “your next chapter”?,"When you retire or semi-retire, people often ask what you have in mind for your “next chapter.” I find myself getting this question frequently, and it feels like there’s a lot of pressure to follow up all those years of work with some final, big encore. I’m curious to know how others respond when they get a similar question. What do you tend to say to people who ask this question? What's your explanation of what you are planning for that ""next chapter""? Like me, do you feel similar pressure in having to come up with something?"
Is there a website to connect people for shared living arrangements in retirement?,"I am 64 years old male, single, my children are grown and I have multiple sources of income so I can cover my part of the expenses. I don't have any vices like addiction to alcohol or drugs. No degenerate Behavior. No animals and no desire to keep animals. Not smoker. I don't play my music at a loud obnoxious level. Just a quiet guy trying to get through life.
    Well I've been unable to find a connection because people want roommates with animals, drug habits, and deviant Behavior. I can cover my expenses every month but other people don't seem to be able to do that like keeping a regular job.
      I have a belief that people can look out for each other and help each other in our golden years. Like taking someone to the doctor for example. I do have medical training. I've seen people coming to the emergency room that we're laying on the floor for eight days before they were found.
   Anyway, any suggestions would be appreciated."
What alternative would you choose to wind down your working life and retire?,"A couple of years ago as COVID was waning, the company I was with announced their return-to-work plan.  Since my local office was closed in the height of the pandemic, the options presented to me were to either relocate to an office on the other side of the country OR to opt out, train a replacement, and be awarded an enhanced severance package (9 months of pay) for staying until a certain date.   I chose the latter as I thought it might be a good way to start a retirement transition and lose stress from managing several software development teams in a chaotic environment.  I left just over a year ago and had a job all lined up with nearly the same salary – I felt very fortunate.

  
I have just passed my one-year anniversary on the replacement job with a wonderful company and a team of developers (I’m doing development work now – no management).  But despite this, it has been hard to derive a lot of satisfaction from the work mainly because I’m the “weak link”.  People have been there a LONG time and know the system very well.  I’m kind of the village idiot asking plenty of questions and taking longer than I would like to get work done.  I am also the oldest developer there and everyone has a pretty good idea that I likely will not stay that long.

  
So now the options before me and I’m asking here because I am sure some of you have been through something similar…

  
Option 1 – Keep my head down and work for about 2 ½ years, at which point, I’ll be in decent shape to retire (At least the Monte Carlo for me in that scenario is in the mid-90s range of success (assuming an average stock market, of course)).  If I take this approach, I will need to improve my abilities outside of work and become a better contributor.  It also involves commuting to work three times a week, about an hour each way.  But the salary and benefits with this firm are great!

  
Option 2 – Seek a job in the industry where I spent much of my early career in and have greater competencies.  I am reasonably confident I could find something locally that would not involve a lengthy commute and the company I have in mind also has good benefits.  I know I could help people more by working in this industry and I would certainly feel a lot better about what I could contribute to the success of the company.  But the wage would be half what I make now - at most.  If I work there for about the next 4+ years, I’ll be Medicare eligible so I won’t have to worry about that awkward time when one is not eligible.

  
Just wondering if others faced a similar decision and what you might have done to make it to the finish line.  What might you have changed with your decision?  Thanks for your input.

Realized that I’m not cut out to invest in individual stocks. I keep checking price every day.,"About to retire with a good pension.

Looking for a sanity check. Recently retired from the military and starting a second career as a civilian. Realistically how long would I have to continue working?,"As the title says, just retired from the military. 

Here’s my stats. 
- Divorced father of two teens. 
- Military pension (after ex-wife gets her portion, she will continue to get it, whether she remarried or not,until I die) is about $3500/mo (before taxes)
- Current job pays 130,000/year (before taxes)
- Possibly getting a small disability pension from the VA for combat injuries, not sure what it will be yet. 

Assets
- Have a home I purchased after the divorce, worth $350,000ish, owe about $250,000ish
- Military 401k (we call it TSP): $300,000
- Civilian 401k: $196,000 (still funding at the max)
- Investment account: $155,000 (still funding at about 8k/year

Liabilities 
-  House: $250k left
- Child support for three more years: $43k total

Other
- Vehicles are paid off
- No alimony (paid lump sum when divorce finalized)
- 48 years old and in decent health
- Will have healthcare coverage for the rest of my life (currently about $700/year)
- Started a new 401k, maxing out at 6%, company matches it, total 12%
- College is fully paid for both kids using state prepaid plan.

It probably would increase our monthly cost of living which would be offset by the interest made on money from selling the house. 

Selling and buying immediately would require short term financing.

Reinvesting dividends or selling the underlying securities?,"Recently retired and have read dozens of sub-Reddits on similar topics, but still a bit confused.

"Experienced retirees, do you ever beat yourself up for letting time slide by in spite of having limited good years left?","Anyone who retirees at a traditional retirement age is probably pretty darned aware of having a limited number of good years left, and a limited number of years period.

Best way to fund downsized new house as we near retirement,"We are looking to downsize. Current home is worth about $400k. New house will cost $550k. We want one level living and to be nearer to our one child and her family.

Husband and I are both 62. He is already retired. I will retire in June 2024. We will have a pension of about $4k per month. Our health insurance will be covered through employer until age 65. We will use a separate savings account to supplement our pension income until FRA. Our monthly expenses are roughly $6k per month. Once we collect SS, we will have more monthly income than we'll need.

We have about $700K in retirement savings that we have no intention of touching until RMDs.

We also have a brokerage account with about $150K. We also have an inherited IRA with about $50K that we need to deplete over the next few years. We are thinking of using this money to offset the expense of the new home. We'll take a mortgage until we sell our current home. I don't want a mortgage (especially at today's rates) for longer than we'll need to.

The brokerage account has had some ups and downs, but everything has been held in access of 1 year, so it would all be long term capital gains. We are in the 22% tax bracket.

Does this make the most sense?

"Insurances, Mortgage, Healthcare, Cars, etc... expenses, expenses, expenses","""Expenses"" is one factor in the equation that we all need in our retirement planning.  We cannot figure out how much we need to save if we don't know how much we will need.  The equation can be quite simple and straightforward as:  (annual)

Expenses (in retirement) - fixed income(s) (social securities, pension, rentals, dividends, etc.) = savings (401k, IRA, brokerage, inheritance, checking/savings, etc.) needed each year.

One would then take the amount of savings needed and multiply by 25 or 30 (depending how long one thinks s(he) will live).  This is very simplistic, especially not taking into consideration inflation, returns, etc., but it's a start.

For the lurkers among us and for those who do not have any idea how to start to determine their retirement expenses, here is a list that I have posted here before.  While some will continue to tell me that I am overthinking this (including my wife), the engineer inside me won't let me just swag it.  On another board, one retired gentleman told me what I am doing is incorrect. He indicated that why should I need to figure what I need to spend in details. Simply use my current spending and make sure that I have the same income for it. If not, then reduce my spending accordingly. Yes, again ... the engineer inside of me won't let me do that! I must have the end in mind first, a target to shoot at. After using my trusty spreadsheet, I use NewRetirement Plus and list out the above to model with my savings and fixed incomes.

If you are a spreadsheet builder, I have been using this budget spreadsheet to track our stuffs: ""[How to create Ultimate Personal Budget in Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKyAOjH3Crk)"". It's not hard to follow and build your own.  You could use Mint, YNAB, Quickbooks, etc.

We have been tracking our expenses for the past two years. We came up with needing about 57% - 63% of our current income in retirement. We will pilot our retirement expenses in a couple of years to see what truly we need.

Just waiting now -wonder about retiring before 70- but the financial cost seems high.,"This subreddit is great, BTW. 

Is anyone else just waiting? How do you keep your motivation up?  I know I’m looking at a trade off between money and time. 

I’m almost 69 and planned to “retire” from my job in a year when I’m 70, to maximize SS. Now considering moving that up 6 mos to March, or even earlier. 

But, I have matching 401k at work and I’m maxing that out, also maxing my Roth contributions. I also have a pension from a previous employer. 

I COULD live comfortably right now on SS, 401k disbursements and the pension, BUT  if I retire now I miss out on the final portion of my bonus for 2023 I have to be employed there when it is paid, on March 1 next year- about $25K. 

Cost of retiring now- miss $25k bonus, $300/mo less SS compared to March, contributions to 401k, I’ll miss 6 month of salary. 

Retire in March -collect $25k bonus, can contribute to matching 401k in the meantime. 

If wait until 70 my SS payments will be $210/month more than in March ($510 more then now) and of course, I’ll miss 6 months salary (March - Sept) and full 2024 401k contributions. 

My spouse will get 50% of my FRA SS when I retire, so no advantage or disadvantage with that.  

My health is great but mentally it’s getting harder to stay engaged at work. My spouse’s health is ok, but she’s somewhat physically limited and not going to be able to “travel the world”.  I do see myself working in retirement, doing something interesting and fun, irrespective of the pay. 

Just curious who else is or has been in a somewhat similar spot and/or what your thoughts are. 

Thanks"
Got tips for navigating the morass of Medicare D prescription plans?,"There are a few things that seemed to help me. 

1. You and your spouse will likely have completely different plans. My wife has 7 Rx’s and I have 1.

2. The Medicare.gov site is excellent for finding candidate plans that cover your needs, for the pharmacies you want to use. 

3. Base your plan choice on the overall cost of the plan and the drugs, not the premium cost of the plan. And the overall cost quote will depend on whether you have selected multiple pharmacies, so do that. 

4. You can probably beat the overall cost quoted by using different pharmacies for different drugs. And to even change pharmacies for a drug as you pass through the four stages of coverage.

How to visit adult kids when they move away to different cities?,"I have 3 adult kids. One lives in Colorado and two live in Texas. One of the adult kids will be moving to Canada. I sold my house when the market was booming and moved into an apartment in Texas. I’m all but retired and single and can easily move. Downsized tremendously. One thought is to get out of the apartment and just Airbnb it a month at a time in Colorado, Canada and Texas to visit the kids/grandkids. Has anyone else done something similar? What strategies do you have for bouncing between adult kids living in different cities?"
"Fidelity Wealth Management fee 1.5%, is it worth it?","Hello, I rolled over my company’s 401K to Fidelity Wealth Management about a year ago. It was worth about $800,000 then and has grown by about $100,00 since. My distribution is about 60/40 in the defensive strategy with mutual funds and treasury bonds. My issue is that they have charged me 1.5% fees which have amounted to $12,000. I am 60 and plan to retire next year. I also have another $700,000 at Woodbury which is in mutual funds earning about 15% gains and no fees since I’ve been with them for 20 years. My question is, do I continue to have Fidelity manage my money or do I try to do it myself, or roll it over to Woodbury. To be honest, I’m not very financially savvy.

Medicare vs Advantage what are pros and cons of each,"I had a friend who is a physical therapist in a hospital tell me that Medicare is a better way to go over Medicare Advantage because there are some things that are not allowed under Advantage that Medicare just simply covers.

It didn’t come up as a question trying to compare.  It just came up in discussing their job and general discussion of patient care.

I also have a friend who has had two knee operations and swears by advantage.

I am not 65 yet but I honestly feel that the choice is very confusing.

Part of my question is based on knowing that I have a long term shoulder/bicep issue that I nurse through day to day but probably realize that some type of surgery is required.   I feel I can hold out until 65 and it would cost me way less than my HDHP and its $3000 deductible.

But what are your non bias pros and cons of each?


Edit:   Thanks for all your information.  For what it is worth both my wife and I are (knock wood) pretty healthy.  I have no prescription meds and she has synthroid since she was a baby.  We both are very active and my only issue is a shoulder/bicep problem I had since I hurt it in middle school.  My retired from employer only offers a HDHP and it’s a $3000 deductible until payment kicks in.  Since we don’t really use doctors are spend to deductible is typically very low each year."

"Bond, T-bill, CD Ladder ... Oh My! Tell us about your ladder!","Posting this just for discussion.  I'm not asking for myself. I already have ladders built.  I'm just asking for the benefits of those who lurk in the background and want to ask the question, but are too shy to post. 😉

If you have a [bond ladder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiwkGImECVA&t=6s), cd ladder, or t-bill ladder for retirement income/safety net/or capital preservation, tell us about your logic behind it and any tips/traps to look out for.  Why a bond ladder, why a cd ladder, why a t-bill ladder?  There are plenty of YouTube videos on them.  Just want for others who actually use the investment vehicle to share their experience and results.  It maybe an easy and obvious retirement tool for some, but for others, they may not know about it.

Edit: A little more on capital preservation (especially if one depends more on savings for income to supplement social security and/or pension)- the market is pretty unpredictable.  Our average annualized returns that we have been calculated for so long (to support our safe withdrawal rate) may not happen every year as seen in the past two years.  Even though the long-term average will correct itself with the highs to offset the lows, it doesn't help in the short-term.  The sequence of return risk may ruin our calculated safe withdrawal rate. Yeah, the combination of withdrawing and poor portfolio performance may be tough pill to swallow.  From my understanding, using laddering or even bond tents (or just investing in bond index funds) provides a mechanism to preserve our capital, allowing cash for income, so that the growth portion (namely equity) of the portfolio can recover and then continue to grow.

For my wife and yours truly, currently, we have a cd ladder for our emergency fund (to take advantage of the increasing interest rates): 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year.  As the 3-month matures, we use it to buy another 1 year, ditto with the 6 months and so on. After which, the 1 year auto enroll again. Thus we attempt to create a running 3-month worth of cash if needed.  We like the cd ladder right now when the interest is high.  Once interest goes back down, we may move the matured rung into another investment vehicle that is equivalent to cash.

As we approach my retirement date, we will be building a bond ladder to supply the income needed to supplement our fixed income and for capital preservation portion of our portfolio during market downturn, giving equities a chance to recover.

Cheers

Have a LOT of funds outside 401k because of some recent windfalls.,"Hi everyone. My husband (54) and I (51) got a late start and had significant debt until the pandemic, which we paid off. We have large incomes (over $300k annual HHI in a MCOL area. But we just recently started saving in earnest. Because we just recently got ahead enough to do that and paid off almost $100k in debt (mostly student loans).

All that to say I’m not sure how to go about this. We have an appointment with a Fielity advisor late this month for some adult supervision on our finances but here’s the deal. 

We have 
401k - Just over $250k
Brokerage - $230k (ETFs: SPY, VUG, VTI)
HYSA - $385
CD - $150k

Mortgage: $469 remaining @5.5. Worth 650k. No consumer debt. 

The part I’m having trouble with is most of this is brand spanking new. We sold our home and netted $780k on it. And it’s only in the past five years that we’ve also had RSUs from our jobs. So there is a lot of money floated about and I’m concerned about the potential tax burdens. I know the HYSA is high so thinking I need to move that around a bit but I’m just not sure how best to maximize all this. 

My husband and I are from pretty humble beginnings but are starting to see a future that doesn’t leave us working until we’re 70. That’s both exciting and terrifying. 

Any suggestions? T-bills? IRAs? I’m not even sure what I’m leaving unturned here. 

Thanks!"

Goal: Creating a $20K Roth Emergency Fund. How to do?,"Howdy, All,

I'm new to this sub so TIA for the constructive tips if you've any to share.

My sitch:

I (55F) am a public servant. I have a PERS cooking along (it is veritably hands-off), have established a Def Comp (moderate returns), and will hopefully collect a few shekls from SS. It won't be a lot but it will be enough (fingers crossed). I'm 10ish years out til retirement. I had the idea of creating a Retirement Emergency fund which would act (in some way) as my post-work Health Saving Account. I will have health insurance, but as we all know, copays can be a beetch. 

So, I'd like to create the above with the specific wish of bypassing/mitigating taxation. Also, stable growth is more desireable than pie-in-the-sky growth. I need this to chug along predictably. I would start a series of CDs with healthy, fixed returns but then I'd be kissing the Roth proviso away.

Again, I'm a newbie (despite the age), thank you for your thoughts. Cheers!"

When did you realize that you were on track to truly be able to retire? How old were you at that point?,"When did you realize you were in good enough shape that you would be able to retire?

My husband grew up very poor. He just assumed he would just work and work and work. When met with the financial advisor, I said I would like to retire at 60. My husband said he expected to work until at least 70 and likely much longer. 
When our financial advisor told us, at age 56, that we were in good shape and he could leave work very comfortably at 63, sooner if he wanted, he just did not buy it!
He literally cannot rap his head around it. We've since seen another advisor who echoed the sentiments above and even told us we did could spend more on fun stuff now!

He still cannot imagine walking away while he is able to work, but I'm hoping he gets there because I will be skipping out at 60! What about you all? When did you realize that, financially, you would one day be able to retire and be okay?"

Question about ESOP diversification when turning 55 in 2024,"I’m trying to understand when I can diversify some of my ESOP shares. I will turn 55 in July 2024. I was hoping I could diversify during that month based on the 2023 Plan Year share price. 

However, I was told I can’t diversify until 2025 and after the 2024 share price was set. It seems this is this because I will be 55 during 2024 and not 2023. But the rules don’t seem to indicate that:  
  
*If you are age 55 and have 10 or more years of participation in the Plan, you have the right to diversify your Account under the Plan if your account balance is over $500. For each of the first five years in which you are eligible for diversification, you may diversify up to 25 percent of the value of your Stock Account as of the end of the year. For the sixth and later years, you may diversify up to 50 percent of your Stock Account. The percentages include prior diversification and distributions upon retirement, death, disability or other termination of employment. Elections to diversify must be made during the 90 day period after the end of each Plan Year in which you have the right to diversify and will be carried out within 90 days after the date that you receive an updated stock valuation for the applicable Plan Year. Diversification elections are irrevocable 90 days after the end of each year in which you make a diversification election.*  
  
Based on this, it appears I could diversify in 2024 because the IRS allows the 90 day period to start when the date the value is communicated to participants (IRS Revenue Procedure Letter 15-36). Historically, this has been communicated in May of each year.   
  
So, since my 55th birthday is in July 2024 (which would be within the 90 day period from May), and I have much more than 10 years of service, I would think I could diversify in July 2024 and not 2025 like my company told me is the case.  
  
What is the truth of this matter?

Fidelity's yearly advisory fees are more than double that of Vanguard's?,"Hi, We're (hopefully) within a few years of retiring and we've been looking at potentially swinging away from Vanguard to Fidelity for a number of (mostly minor) reasons.  Fidelity seemed to offer more hand holding so we met with an advisor in a local office. Got a great two hours of her time and some nice printouts on what our revised retirement plan would look like... then came the fees conversation.

We're currently with vanguard paying \~.3% on approx. $1.5m in managed ""flagship"" investments. Fidelity crunched the numbers and quoted us .78% ... and my gum fell out of my mouth. Came out of meeting feeling as though Fidelity will be better at addressing budgeting and light tax planning however the fee difference was staggering.

Nothing complex in investment mix. Outside of our existing 401ks (additional $700k at Fidelity which won't be included in $1.5m managed),  we only have his / hers IRAs, a joint brokerage account and a small Roth. No individual stocks or other.   Vanguard has been ""good"" though the years but we still feel there's a been a big gap our retirement conversation and Vanguard outside of; ""you're doing great!"" hasn't been very good at discussing anything other than the investments themselves.

Can anyone help us through the woods on this?  As always,  thanks in advance!"

One Month Stays in Cities Across the United States,"My (60M) and my partner (66M) have recently retired. We have plenty of income and savings and no debt.

As I understand it, my partner could choose original Medicare and have the same nationwide network that I do (he has an Advantage plan now through AARP). For a long time, we have wanted to sell our house and travel but not in an RV. Instead, we would like to use Airbnb to stay one month in interesting cities in the US and really get to know them and the areas near each. For instance, we could rent a condo in Nashville, Tennessee for about $4,000 a month and get to know that city, as well as Memphis, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and Dollywood. Then, we could pack up and rent a place in Boston for a month; after that, maybe Washington, D.C.

Retirement Distribution Strategies - what is yours?,"Retirees, what is your [retirement distribution strateg](https://money.usnews.com/money/retirement/articles/retirement-distribution-strategies-that-will-make-your-money-last)y?  What works for you so far? Are you using one of the followings or do you have your own?

\- 4% rule - taking out 4% first year and adjusting for inflation thereafter

\- withdraw a fixed percentage - taking out specific percent of the balance

\- withdraw fixed dollar amounts - taking out the same dollar amount every month, quarter or year.

\- limit withdrawals to income generated - more or less taking out dividends and gains each year and leaving principal intact

\- total return - withdrawing by taking the entire investment into account, dividends, interest, growth, and principal based on a particular percentage.

\- create a floor - using/building guaranteed income (social security, pensions, annuities, etc.) to meet basic needs.

\- bucket system - bucket one (cash equivalent for 2-3 years), bucket two (moderate growth for 3-10 years), bucket three (growth cover for 10 years)

\- use account sequencing - withdrawing funds that minimizes taxes and allow money in long-term accounts to grow.

\- time segmentation - similar to bucket; however, dividing the retirement span into smaller segments and invest each segment appropriately (Ex: segment one 1-5 years no market risk; segment two 6-10 years principal preservation; segment three 11-15 years conservative; segment four 16-20 moderate; segment five 20+ aggressive).  As each segment expires, the next segments move to take over the expired segment).

For my wife and I, we have not fully retired (the wife is, I still have 1977 days to go).  We are planning for creating a floor with our expected retirement income with the time segmentation withdrawal as our strategy to supplement our social securities and my pension.

What is your distribution strategy?  What works for you as a retiree?  What would you change, especially during the last two years of rough seas?  Thank you in advance.

Does Medicare Part B - automatically decrease after employment ends,"I'm single and haven't retired yet but will do so soon.  I saw where Medicare Part B is based on the last  your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). When I stop working and my MAGI drops, does my Medicare Part B automatically drop?  I thought I saw somewhere that you have to request a decrease...?  Is that right?  Can someone illuminate me on this?  Thanks"
457 Retirement Account thoughts on two more years investing and then moving into retirement.,"I am 55. I'm fully vested and able to retire with a full pension that also get COLA. I'm thinking about working until 57 with my pension covering 55% of my gross salary. I bring home 45% of my gross salary of which 65% goes toward bills, food and hobbies and 35% of that goes in savings to fund maintenance, projects and other unexpected expenses. Currently 30% of my gross salary is funding my 457 retirement account.

We do not have any mortgages. loans, or CC debt. We have completed major upgrades on the house. Example (bathrooms, kitchen, roof and windows). In retirement we would like to travel a little more. My wife also gets a pension and has money in retirement accounts and savings to help with our future plans.

Questions I have evolve around my 457 retirement account. My local gov employer uses Empower. I have been in the American Funds 2035 Target Date Retirement Fund® Class R-6 -RFFTX and it is starting to get heavy in bonds and less in Growth. The Expense Ratio is .35% which some says is high. I also would like this fund to stay more in growth. I would like to see at least 5-7% in growth a year with allows me to pull a little more out for travel.

I have the option to invest in individual funds with lower fees. I was thinking about moving it to FXAIX - 80% VIMAX -8% VSMAX - 12%. The expense ratio on these is between .02 - .05%. I know moving to this in retirement is not normal but I would like to continue seeing growth on the account. I figure the pension is my safe fund and I could stay a little more aggressive on the 457 account. I would use the funds as needed and may use it more in the first 10 years until my SSA kicks in.  This account in a higher growth could fund 20% of my gross or in the current fund would be about .13% of gross.

SSA will add another 30% of my gross which with it and the pension would equal 85% of my gross pay but I plan to wait until 65 and 1 month for it. That would require me relaying on the 457 more  in those 8 years.

Hope I gave enough background to get some suggestions on how I should handle the 457 account moving forward and into retirement. There are additional funds like American Funds 2060 or 2065 Target Date Retirement Fund but the expense ratio is .38% on those.

what are your thought? Thank You"
For those who needed to return to work: Fighting Ageism?,"Looking for advice for those who needed, or wanted, to return to work: how did you combat ageism?

Relative was recently laid off at 59. They very much want to return to work but are not having any success. Good track record, limited but still a bit marketable skill set, very good worker. White collar. Lower management.

If worse comes to worse, they could retire, but it would be a REAL hit. They very much want/need to work at least until 62.  The problem is, they've been looking for months to no avail. Obviously there's not a definitive way to know why they are not landing a job but IF ageism is a factor, any suggestions to combat this? They have tried the following:

Got an updated resume
Trying not to look super dated when interviewing (wearing contacts, not dressing in an old-fashioned suit, etc)

I realize this is the retirement board. But I didn't find another board to address this and I'm assuming there are people here that faced this. Any suggestions are welcome, but of course also feel free to ignore if thinking about returning to work is the last thing you want to discuss!"
"Musings about ACA subsidy eligibility, and plans concerning same","Because of some other recent texts on this board, I have been thinking about the ways in which I have and  have intended to, arrange my affairs (mostly my MAGI) to maximize my eligibility for ACA subsidies, especially in 2026 and 2027, when the dreaded ""cliff"" is scheduled to come back from the dead.

I (61), and my wife (59) currently get subsidized ACA coverage. I will turn 65 in mid-August of 2027, and my wife will follow in December 2028. So we potentially have about two years in which we might have to pay unsubsidized premiums, assuming that:

1. Our MAGI is over 400% of poverty (currently, about $75,000);
2. Congress does not extend the waiver of the 400% FPL cutoff; and
3. We are still alive in those years.

My strategy has been to keep working until I have enough cash to pay our expenses until I turn 65, and therefore I can avoid having any employment income included in my ACA.   This week, I got the bad news that, to qualify for subsidies,  my income has to be below the cutoff for ALL of 2027, not just the part of the year when I will be getting the ACA coverage. Effectively, that adds four months to the time that I have to be ready to live without wage income.

However, I also got some good news--sort of. I found that my shares in a bond mutual fund have no capital gains, and no accrued dividends, so I could redeem/sell those shares with no effect on my MAGI. That account goes a long way to making up my income gap for the next four years.  In fact, I will be better off right now if I sell those shares and put them into a CD ladder.

However, I have also started to think about the ""big picture""--perhaps I am letting the tail wag the dog. Our annual ACA subsidy is about  $12,000.  To get $12,000 net, I have to make about $16,000 gross. If someone offered me a job with the time commitment, responsibility, and accountability of my current job, for a salary of $16,000, I  would firmly and politely decline. But that is, in essence, what I am doing, if I am just staying at my job to hold on to an ACA subsidy that may or may not present a problem in four years.  If we don't qualify for the subsidy for 23 months, it will be annoying  to pay the entire premium, but certainly not financially disastrous.

I am increasingly coming to the conclusion that, rather than try to plan out long-term events based on conditions that I can't control or foresee, maybe I should just do what I want, and not spend all this time perseverating about the ACA, with the confidence that I can figure things out in the future, as I have been figuring things out since that time that I used lawn mowing money to open a passbook savings account when I was thirteen (and Gerald Ford was President).

55+ Communities in Eastern PA- How you choose the most socially active?,"My husband and I are looking for a 55+ Community in Eastern PA, since family is in NJ and CT.  We know the tax advantages of PA and the downside of cold/snow but since we don’t know many people in that particular area, how do we go about finding the most socially  active places to buy in these communities?  Cost is a factor too, so that already limits us to resales.  I’ve got a few years to work yet he’s retired so we figured a blend of social activities would help me nights and weekends and he could join when he wanted to.

"Should I keep my HSA? I turn 65 soon, I have an HSA with a few thousand left. Should I close it out eventually or contribute as much as possible short term to reap the benefits?",The IRS rules are confusing.
Question on how to handle short term (monthly - up to 12 months out) funds,"I am moving pre-tax 401K funds to an IRA and moving some taxed 401K funds to a regular account. I determined my mix of US stocks, international stocks and bonds for my long term funds. I want to leave 12 months of funds in a more stable investment. Would I look at short term bonds? Intermediate term bonds? If I am looking specifically at Fidelity and wanted to park say 18K and take out 1500 a month, what would be a good place to keep that? Or is a high yield savings account or a money market account a safer choice?

If you tuck away 12 months of money (after accounting for social security and pensions), where do you tuck that money so you can get it, but it isn't sitting there earning nothing?"
How happy are you these days on a scale of 1 (horribly) to 10 (alive and doing great!),"Retirement life can be tough.

Despite all that, I’m a firm 10.  I’ve got someone to love, Mrs OM, something to do (10 acres and there’s always something to do) and something to look forward to.  Tomorrow, we’ll hit the gym at 0820 and then, nachos and college football.  Church on Sunday morning, a (rural) neighborhood barbecue in the late afternoon and Mrs OM has Monday off.

Question about the 4% or 3% rule for early retirement.,"Edit:  Many thanks for the education!  I appreciate everyone helping us out.

Wife and I happen to be in a good spot, and are wondering if the 3/4% rule works at any age?   Say for example we both retired today (mid-late 50’s) and began to draw 3 or 4 % which totally covered our lifestyle (+ medical insurance while we are on our way to Medicare eligibility), would the draw still have a 99% chance of lasting our lifetimes?   Or does the 3 or 4 % rule ONLY work when you start at 65?   

The good news is that we both expect SS - but don’t want to start drawing down too early and get stuck if we both age well.  Thanks for advice!n"
Does the 4% Rule Apply to Me when I don’t want to leave anything behind?,"I plan to retire at 65, and should have about $2 million in retirement accounts, as well as about $3,500/month in social security.  I’ll own my home that is currently worth around $850k.  

I’m single (twice divorced) and can’t imagine ever getting married again.  I have no children and never will.  

In short, I have no one I wish to leave any inheritance too.  

I read a lot about the 4% rule, but that sees designed for people that want to leave something behind.  Personally, I’ll view it as a tremendous failure if I die with money in the bank.  

Is there a different/better approach for people like me?  I suppose it all comes down to the unknown of f how long I’ll live.  20-30 years post retirement seems reasonable to me.  Towards the end of my life I would plan to sell my home and live out the rest of my days on the proceeds from that.

HSA and/or Regular Health Insurance during retirement,"Does anyone here have an HSA and/or  Regular Health Insurance or HSA only? I have health insurance and like my insurance but a lot of people say this a good idea (tax benefit) to have an HSA to help or alternative to Long Term Care?

I'm working again after five years of retirement...,"Five years ago, I retired.

Retirement accounts : can you have a Roth and a IRA?,"Hi everyone, I'm not close to retirement age but my dad's 70 and I'm thinking of the future. I have a small Roth currently and he has his 401k through his work which I'm on as a beneficiary.
 If he happened to pass away what would I do to claim this and could I just set up a new IRA in addition to the Roth I have now so I can put away more money ? I know the limit on Roths is like 6k I think. I wouldn't just want to put all the money I'd get from his 401 into my bank account. I'm very new to all this retirement saving stuff (my Roth is only 1 yr old). Wasn't sure if even having both a Roth and a IRA together is allowed."

Their Terms and Conditions allow them to delay indefinitely. Another forum post said they are on day four of waiting for digital gift cards totaling $2,300.  Buyer beware."
Optimizing income to maximize ACA subsidies using treasury zeros,"It's interesting how ACA created a new financial challenge for those under 65. We want income to be as low as possible to pay less in taxes while maximizing ACA subsidies which could be about $12k/yr. This can be done if you have cash available or capital gains losses to offset future capital gains. 

One way to minimize income for a few years without taking too much market risk is to buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway which doesn't pay dividends and is a well managed reliable conglomerate with lots of cash. Still nothing is risk free.

With interest rates possibly reaching it's peak, it occurred to me that I should buy treasury zeros maturing after age 65. This will reduce interest income in the next few years and spread income after age 65. Treasury zeros don't pay dividends, you just get a lump sum when they mature. You still need to pay taxes every year though. The other benefit is that if interest rates drop, the TZ bond prices will rise.

Does this looks like a good idea if you have enough cash saved. Any other tips?"
Social Security Question - Should waiting to draw result in a linear increase?,"I logged into my social security today to try and decided the optimal age to being withdrawing.  I understand that it increases the longer you wait to start drawing, however I expected the percent increase to be somewhat linear.

These monthly withdrawals amounts are directly from [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov).  The percent increase is calculated as follows: for example 62 to 63-> ((2716/2541) -1)\*100

 Age MonPmt % Increase  
62	$2,541	  
63	$2,716	6.89%  
64	$2,907	7.03%  
65	$3,159	8.67%

67	$3,644	6.77%  
68	$3,801	4.31%  
69	$4,102	7.92%

Priority for retirement in 10 years: pay off mortgage or sock away money in 401k?,"I went through a divorce in 2019 that cut my retirement savings in half. I had a good amount put away, but that really hurt. I want to retire in 10 years, and I have a financial advisor who says that is very possible if I sock away as much money as I can into my 401k. I have a 30-year mortgage on my current house that I bought in 2020. If I make extra payments on it, I can have it paid off in 10 years. Here are my calculations regarding this:

If I continue making regular payments without additional payments toward the principal, the home will be paid off in 2050, and the accumulated interest that I will have paid will be $110k.

If I make additional $1,000 payments toward the principal each month, the home will be paid off in 2032, and the accumulated interest will be $62k. The extra payments will have been $1,000 x 104 = $104,000.

My financial advisor recommends that I not focus on paying off my mortgage and instead put as much as I can into my 401k, but I have a couple of friends who think it's a much better plan to pay off my mortgage as soon as I possibly can. I'm tending to agree with them since I don't think I want to go into retirement still having to make a mortgage payment for another 18 years. It may make more sense financially to focus on putting money in my 401k as recommended by my advisor, but from an emotional perspective, I would much rather be mortgage-free in 10 years and know exactly where I stand at that time.

I'm curious to hear others' opinions."

How?? I don’t understand how making money is possible…,"I don’t even know how to ask this, but I’m sure it’s a dumb question. I’m terrible at math especially financial math(is that a thing)? How are we ever going to make money on mutual funds or stocks or whatever? What I mean is: I watch my retirement funds go up (yay) then go down (boo). Seems like at the end of the day we are all just breaking even but when I use those online retirement calculators and enter in my numbers (age, current salary, percent I save monthly, etc) it seems I’m track to have a nice nest egg. Other than the money we put into our 401k, how are we actually making money? Aren’t we breaking even?"
"Vanguard retirement account needs to be added to, with some other investments that are dangling out by themselves",Does anyone know the best way to speak to a live representative?

Do you consider yourself wealthy and in what ways?,"There are a variety of ways in which you can be wealthy, all of which hold a different significance in your life. They include:    
 
📌 Time wealth: The most fundamental wealth that enables all other forms. It's valuable for personal growth and can be converted into other forms of wealth like skills, relationships and financial wealth. 
📌 Physical and mental wealth: Physical health serves as insurance against aging, while good mental health is vital for happiness. The two are interlinked and essential for enjoying life. 
📌 Relationship wealth: Family, close friends and social connections contribute to your emotional well-being. These relationships are unique to each individual and cannot be bought or transferred. 
📌 Skills wealth: You hold wealth in your skills, which can lead to financial wealth. Skills are valuable, transferable and convertible, serving as a precursor to monetary success.  
📌 Financial wealth: Highly coveted due to its convertibility and ability to provide options. It's visible and measurable, but its value can overshadow other forms of wealth. 
 
You might overvalue things that can easily be measured, but they may not be the most valuable elements in your life. Take pause and assess where you are putting in your energy today, before it’s too late. From Casey at Howard Bailey."
What's your experience with travel health insurance when you're out of the country?,"Now that we're on Medicare, and traveling quite a bit, we've been buying travel health insurance for each foreign trip. We never insure the price of the trip, just the potential medical portion. Fortunately, we haven't had to use it.  But my cardiologist just told us that he had a patient who had a heart issue on a cruise ship and ended up with a $35,000 bill. Buying the insurance is a little confusing because of ""primary"" and ""secondary"" coverage. I know our supplement will pay some, but I'm curious what experiences people have had.  "
"How long , is too long, for family and friends to visit?","An acquaintance likes to say… It is time when the toilet paper roll runs out 😉 . For me, it depends on the visitor. Food, entertainment, and time together expectations can wildly differ."
Do any of you have those moments where you can't believe that retirement is real now that you've actually made it?,"I'm more than two years into this and still have several moments each week where I can't believe that my time is my own.  It usually hits me on a weekday morning around 9 or 10 o'clock as I'm walking to my workshop to find something to tinker on or repair.  It also usually comes to mind when I'm booking a flight or looking for interesting tours or activities to take in on our next trip.  
It's wonderful and I'm rarely bored but it seems like this surreal feeling will never completely pass. I wonder if that's a good thing. I think it may be.
How long have you been retired and do you experience this feeling at all (or how frequently)?"
"Gentlement of /r/retirement, tell me about your post-retirement friendmaking","I know it can be tough for retirees and especially men, but I wonder if I'm in the average range or if I'm having more trouble than most. I've been doing most of the stuff that people say to do which gets me out of the house and out of my head, but hasn't produced anything approaching friendships. So please tell me your experience, and if you've developed new friendships please tell me how it developed!

I've joined a gym. The exercise is great, but as far as meeting people, everyone has their earbuds in and their heads down on their phones. Nobody talks to anybody, except for some groups of young bros who seem to be workout buddies.

I've done several volunteer gigs. I get assigned to do some solitary activity; totally ignored by paid employees, no opportunity to interact with other volunteers, who in any case are different people each time I come back.

I've taken up pickleball. People at the local courts seem to be there more to compete than to socialize, nobody is interested in friendly chit-chat while waiting for a court. I like the game, but socially it's a zero.

I've got a dog and go several times a week to the local dog park. I guess this is where I've come closest to making friends, in that I see the same people and we say hi to each other and chat a tiny bit. It's better than nothing, but I don't get the feeling that it's ever going to progress from ""friendly acquaintances"" to ""friends"".

I've looked for local social clubs and active meetup groups, but there are none where I live.

What am I hoping for from these desired ""friends""? I guess I'd say a few people with whom I can make a plan -- or just call on the spur of the moment, or be called by -- to go for a hike, a move, lunch, happy hour, beer in the backyard. Ideally people with whom I can have comfortable conversations about our lives, our interests, people who are comfortable both listening and sharing.

So please tell me your experience, and if you've developed new friendships please tell me how it developed!

[EDIT] Maybe obvious, but I'm specifically asking about men's experiences because it seems that men and women frequently have very different habits and norms of friend-making. Not always, not everyone, but it seems like a real thing.[/EDIT]

[EDIT #2] Thanks everyone for chiming in; it's great to read all the suggestions. I'm especially interested in hearing from the menfolk about their own personal experience -- what they've tried, how it went, what did/didn't work, how an introduction evolved into a friendship, etc -- so please share those stories!

"What Are Your Benchmarks for HCOL, MCOL, and LCOL ?","I see references to cost of living  being high, medium or low which can impact decisions about where to live in retirement which got me thinking.  What are the benchmarks to define this?   I'm in the central US and think of my area as being  between low and medium based largely on housing, taxes, and fuel costs.  Are there any objective benchmarks for the cost of living descriptors?  I understand there is subjectivity with this so I'm interested in opinions of others.  Thanks. "
What type of account can I contribute to if my only income is disability,"I have traditionally contributed to a simple IRA (now converted to a traditional) and a Roth IRA, but now my only income source is disability.

A couple of inspiring retired traveling couples on YouTube,"You probably won't ever want to sell everything and travel full time, but lately my wife and I have been watching YouTube videos by a couple of couples who did just that and they're both informative and inspiring:

- [Retirement Travelers](https://www.youtube.com/@RetirementTravelers)
- [Brian and Carrie](https://www.youtube.com/@BrianandCarrie)

The first has us thinking about travel to Asia, something that wasn't really on our radar, and the second gave us a bunch of Romanian cities we'd never heard of to add to an upcoming trip."
"This is just my personal thoughts on my own future retirement, so feel free to chime in with better suggestions","Before you retire, make sure you have enough savings and investments to support your future. That means planning your retirement fund and regularly evaluating your asset allocation. Also, consider purchasing a retirement pension or annuity to ensure you have a steady stream of income.At the same time, pay attention to maintaining good health, which is very important in retirement life. Establish healthy and active lifestyle habits, get regular medical checkups, and consider medical and health insurance.Retirement does not mean doing nothing, on the contrary, it is an opportunity to start a new phase of life. You might consider pursuing a hobby, getting involved in volunteer work or community activities, running your own entrepreneurial venture, or pursuing a career you've always dreamed of.The most important thing is to set a clear goal and plan before retiring, as well as some backup plans. This will help you face any unexpected situations that may arise and ensure you are prepared for any changes the future may bring"
Interested in moving retirement & brokerage account,"Interested in moving brokerage and retirement account from AUM model to fidelity, vanguard or schwab.

Yes you can travel internationally in retirement and it doesn't have to be super expensive.,"If you want to travel internationally now that you're retired, but you've looked at cruises and tours and they're just too expensive, don't despair.   You need to learn some tricks and avoid package tours.  Best place to start is with Rick Steves' videos, books, and forums.  Then check out sites like The Points Guy to maximize credit car perks.  Do your research as to the most economical times of the year and the cheapest places.  Lastly, use review sites like Trip Advisor to pick hotels.  Bulk up at a ""free"" hotel breakfast and pack a bunch of protein bars so you only have to buy one full meal a day.  Travel by train - you have time now."
"People who retired about five years ago, you've weathered a lot, what is your advice?","Just wondering what the thoughts are from those who retired roughly five years ago.

Long Term Care insurance: Do we need it and how to go about getting it.,"My husband is retiring in a year and a half. I am 5 years younger, so will be working at least another 5 years. Our finances are looking good, my only question is: should we look into purchasing long term care insurance?"
"Free session with planner—so far so good, I think.","I had a free session with a planner today (through my company). I’ll have a follow up session after he runs my report, but I anticipate getting the big sell on him managing my money for a fee, which is likely to be a giant “no.” 

But I was surprised by a couple of things: 

1) he cited a 4% SWR. I pointed out that I have no heirs and I’m really not interested in preserving my capital, so I was thinking of shooting for 5%. I’ll also be almost age 61 at time of retirement, and women in my family historically die at age 86, and I’m not all that healthy. I mean, I hope to live to 100 if I can and am healthy, but it really seems unlikely. 

2) he was not aware that Medicaid put a lien on your home if you have a house and have to go into a nursery by home on Medicaid’s dime. I mentioned that’s the situation with my mom and he literally said “I had no idea.” I’m guessing most of his clients are so rich that it’s not a factor, but still. 

He did point out that I probably have too much in my 401k and not enough in my Roth, so I’ll probably get killed on taxes. I’ve got some time to deal with that. He also agreed with me that it doesn’t especially make sense to pay off the house given my low interest rate (2.75). 

I’m glad I met with him, if nothing else to be reassured I’m on track. We’ll see what the second meeting holds."
Liveaboard Boat Retirees. Is it worth it? Unexpected expenses?,We are considering retiring early. We have 1 house paid off and owe 125K on another that we plan on selling (value 450K).

"Now that you have retired, what advice would you give people just entering the world of work?","The title says it…

If anyone cared to listen to an old coot, I’d say don’t depend on your job for your happiness or for your identity. If you find it rewarding that’s wonderful, you’re very blessed, but jobs can change for the worse or disappear entirely.  You are an employee — a job’s not a relationship. Second, the odds of you being able to change a bad work situation are very low — be proactive and be ready to find a new job if you’re in a bad spot.  Lastly, debt makes you a slave (even though it *is* sometimes necessary) — always spend less than you make."
Should I get a total knee replacement if I'm not ready?,"Please help me decide what to do. My doctor has told me I would qualify for a knee replacement. Yet he also recommended I wait as long as possible. I am not in pain, Although I do have stability issues with stairs, etc. Now I find out I am about to be forced to retire early. My family thinks I should go ahead and get the replacement while I still have health care benefits. I probably have about 6 months before I am to be forced to retire. Is there other options?
Update:::
Thank you all for your wise advice. What a wonderful community. I made an appointment with my orthopedics doctor to discuss my options. I think I will be going the route of an unloader brace, pt,   and injections for now. It doesn't feel right to rush surgery just because I will be losing my health insurance.  You all are very resilient and honestly tough as nails to have gone through all of this knee pain, surgery, and rehab!"
Are my friends Volunteering too much? Their days seem too busy.,"I’ve gotten some great feedback and will certainly look at things differently now. I have shut off replies. 

I’ve been retired 5 years. After working so hard for many years, I’ve not yet feel the need to donate my time to organizations.  We do donate funds to several local agencies, and donate blood as often as allowed. I have tried to stay in touch with friends, but several of them are so involved with donating their time, jumping from one thing to another, that they don’t seem to have time to get together, or even reply to a text or email. I’ve never been bored, and have plenty of activities of my own to fill my days, I just don’t understand the need to devote so much time to churches, animal shelters, etc. Thoughts?"
"Do any of you do consulting, now that you're retired?","An earlier post here suggested updating your LinkedIn profile to list “consultant” as occupation. But what’s involved in making that a reality? Do you have to form an LLC? Is that a pain? I’m not sure I want to go to the trouble if I’m only half serious about it. I would appreciate any thoughts from people who have started an LLC to support their consulting, or from those who are successfully consulting at a pace they like without forming an LLC."
Retirement expense budget- reasonable or unreasonable?,"Hi forum.  I’m looking for any feedback you may have or info you would be willing to share.  62/60 cpl in SE US, specificallly looking for info regarding living expense in retirement.  I have paid advisors but get a blank stare when I ask about reasonableness of my estimated expenses in retirement.  My current estimate is $6500-7500/mo inc. SS in current dollars.  No mortgage and no other debt at all, just the usual.  We’ve seen the world already, not major travel planned.  Two adult kids with high priced educations(yeah, paid for by us).  I know this often has to do with retirement resources and this range is within my ability, but what do you think?  We live middle/upper middle class life; mo country clubs, no high class society friends to keep up with etc. Am I planning too low?"
A satisfying and amusing activity you can enjoy when you retire,"Go to a bar that has a happy hour.  You can get there as soon as happy hour starts -- you got nowhere to be, after all.  Now wait for a work group to show up.  Observe how everyone laughs at the boss's jokes (you can always spot the boss -- it's like spotting the pack leader in a nature documentary).  The forced camaraderie. The quiet one at the end of the table who keeps looking at his watch hoping to get out somewhere near his usual quitting time. The annoying earnest one hoping to impress. You know what's going on, just a few weeks ago you might have been there yourself... and now you realize you're free, free at last.

This is even more fun if you're with a retired friend and can enjoy it together."
"Where did the majority of your retirement funding, come from?","There are many different ways to save for retirement. Some are using real estate (landlord or selling property), a business (sell or get ownership payments), insurance products, brokerage accounts/ savings, or inheritance... Then we have other options that have evolved over time. In general, pensions started in the later part of the 1800’s (and never covered more than half of people). The first social security payment was January 1940. Back in 1974 the IRA was born. Then in 1981 the first defined contribution plan (401k) was started. Many of us have multiple sources.

My grandmother had social security and little in brokerage. My father, a pension. Myself, the majority is retirement plans. You?

Timing for Roth Conversions before Social Security and Medicare,"I’m 54 and would like to retire at 60. My 1.2M 401k is mostly pretax with only about 45k of the total investment in Roth. I want to minimize my income to get a decently subsidized ACA premium until I can enroll in Medicare at 65. I will likely need to begin drawing from the taxable 401k at 60 to make ends meet before I begin collecting SS and a small pension at 65.  

Do I begin converting pretax to Roth now while I’m still working?   I’m thinking that would be a mistake since I’m in a higher tax bracket right now.  Or wait until 60 when my tax bracket is lower?   

Has anyone come up with a strategy to keep income low enough during this in-between period and willing to share how you did it?"
"I Thought that I wanted to retire, but really just wanted new self-employment","I have practiced law as a sole practitioner for about 25 years.  I have always concentrated my practice fairly narrowly in a specific area of the law.  About eighteen months ago, I hit a wall, and just couldn't practice law any more.  In April of 2022, I started winding down my practice, and referred out most of my cases. I kept about 1/3 of my caseload to finish by myself, then I was going to retire. However, as I was getting rid of my cases, some colleagues started referring me cases in an area of the law that was   totally outside of my old area of practice.

A few referrals turned into more referrals, and by the time that I got rid of my old cases, I had built up a new practice in a new area of law. Now, about 16 months later,  I have gotten rid of all the cases from my ""old"" practice, and have transitioned into a new area which I find interesting, and which pays a higher rate than my old line  of work.  I have transitioned my practice entirely from one area of practice to another one. 

It turns out that, while I thought that I wanted to retire, I actually just wanted to practice a different type of law.  I am 61, and I only intend to practice another 2-3 years in any event  But, in essence, and within the context of self-employment, I ""quit"" one job, and got another ""job."" I no longer dread going to work every morning, and I look forward to opening my emails.  I am glad that I did not close my practice thinking that I wanted to retire, when I actually only wanted a change of pace. 

(I had a colleague who retired from the corporate law department of a major insurance company. He thought that he wanted to retire, but after about three months of retirement, he realized that he really just needed a leave of absence.  Unfortunately, he was too old to go back to work, from a practical point of view--his employer had filled his slot with a  younger lawyer who would work for 40% of my friend's  compensation package. The sad thing is that he could easily have gotten an extended vacation from his employer, if only he had known that he wanted a sabbatical rather than a retirement. I am glad that didn't happen to me,)"
Seeking options for financing a move after retiring,"We live on one side of a large metro area and our kids and grandkids are on the other side.  In addition, we're in a house and really want an association-maintained property of some kind (ideally a detached townhome).   The problem is, while we have substantial net worth, most of it is either in retirement accounts (and most of that would be taxable if we withdrew money) or in our current paid-for house.

So we need some kind of short term financing to move, but loan origination fees are huge -- the entire system is designed for people who want a long-term mortgage (e.g., folding the origination fee into the payments -- payments we don't want to have long term).  Another option would be to sell our house, rent, and then buy with cash, but there are so few places for sale these days we might end up stuck in a rental, not to mention having to move twice.

I'd be interested in hearing from others who solved this problem -- there may well be an option I'm overlooking."
Has anyone retired in order to open opportunities for younger colleagues?,"I know two clergy who told me that they retired as soon as their financial situation allowed, in order to open up their jobs for younger clergy. Each one had started work in their trade at at time when (as they perceived it), older people in the field held on to their jobs long after the customary retirement age, which impeded the opportunities for younger people. Each one of my friends had vowed, at that time, that they would never be part of that type of professional logjam.

In my part of the country, there is a regional law firm that has a tradition of partners retiring at 65. The stated purpose of this tradition is to free up ownership shares in the firm for distribution to younger partners, so that the younger partners can make more money at times in their lives when the younger colleagues have large cash needs (home mortgages, college tuitions, etc,)

Has anyone retired specifically in order to get out of the way and make room for younger people in your trade?"
How do you use your 401k in retirement if not for real estate?,"I was reading another thread about someone thinking about using some of their 401k to purchase a house. I think most commenters responded it was not a good idea to do so. I was thinking of doing the same, using part of my 401k, in addition to other savings, to purchase a second home if I need the additional funds. In retirement I will have 2 pensions and SS, so I won’t need to live off my 401k money, and have a husband who is currently collecting his pension/SS, he did not have a 401k, but deferred comp under 100k. His retirement came with the same health insurance. Of course we have taxes, condo fees, etc.

I guess my real question is what should a 401k be used for to get the most out of it? When I retire, I will have to decide where to put the money, eventually I expect to take dividends. But why, if I am looking to purchase real estate, is using some of my 401k money is not a good option? Is it only the tax hit?

Thanks."
"When you go out with your kids, who picks up the bill?","When I was working, I paid the bill for my kids when we went out to eat. I did this even though they had good incomes.

"Now back to regretting deciding to retire, vs new job","I had two consulting offers, decided to not take them, retire, move, work part time for medical

Withdrawing from 401k to purchase a home in retirement? Advice Needed.,"I am 65 and coming up on retirement before 2024. I’ve been looking forward to this day for years and it’s finally coming near, but now that I’m here I’m also not sure how to optimize the little funds I have to make sure I don’t run out.

Context: I’m moving to Georgia to be closer to family and have $350K cash. I have another $500K in 401K funds. I plan to collect SS upon retirement for guaranteed income of about $3K a month. 

Situation: I would like to purchase a condo in Georgia to live mortgage free. I am looking at a $450K purchase price. I am estimating about $1K in monthly expenses including condo fees, insurance and taxes. A SFH would be about $500 cheaper but I hate lawn care and I want to live in a more urban environment in my old age. 

This means I need to liquidate $120K from my retirement funds for this purchase. This will leave me about $20K or so in emergency savings in addition to my SS. I anticipate living expenses of around $2K/mo and am planning to use my SS to find 100% of my living costs with monthly withdrawals from the remaining $380K of retirement funds for any other larger purchases, vacations, etc.

If I keeps my withdraws to 4%, that means I can have an additional $1.2K in income from my 401K funds without worrying about it running out. The remaining 401K investments are mostly in mutual funds. 

Advice needed: Does this make sense? Am I out of my mind using $100K of 401K funds for a home? What am I missing? Anything I can do better? What’s the best way to take monthly distributions?

Help! Thank you!"
Should we consolidate brokerage accounts at a single firm?,"Hello all.  My wife and I are retired after multiple careers and multiple employers.  We have a collection of investments at different firms: T Rowe Price,  Janus, Schwab, Vanguard, Computershare.  We have IRAs, Roth, Inherited IRAs, and standard brokerage accounts.

Thanks for any suggestions."
Joint vs Individual Brokerage Account and Spousal Benefits,"I'm setting up a standard, taxable brokerage intended for my spouse and I's retirement.  We do not live in a community property state.  I was wondering if I opened the account as an individual account, upon my death, my spouse would get the full step up in basis rather than half if it had been a joint account.

Does this sound right?

I can open a joint account, which would be nice, but if my spouse could get the full step up in basis, that would be better!

I realize, this may be of little consequence if our withdrawl rates fall within a zero to very low tax bracket, which they will.  However, I was thinking if at some point my spouse had to sell all assets for long term care or make a charitable gift, this might matter and could be a significant amount of money.  20 years or more in the market adds up.

I may be misunderstanding how this works and if this matters at all! 

Part 2,

How difficult or easy is it for widows/widowers to get ahold of a spouses assets upon their death?  I'm refering to retirement or individual brokerage accounts, not joint accounts.   I'm assuming you send in a death certificate and within 30-60 days or so, the brokerage account is in your name.  Is this right?"
Should I continue postpone retirement in hopes to get severance package?,"I'm 60.  I've been planning to retire in less than six months.     Debt free.  No work pension, but saved $3M in 401k, Roth, and investments.  I've allocated about  $200K for  child's college education.      In other words, financially, I believe we are in decent shape.   

I haven't mentioned my retirement plans to my employer because I am hoping to get laid off to get 8 month severance package.   My company is planning a workforce reduction within 12 months or less.    (Company is relocating to different state).   I don't enjoy working but the pay is good  ($150K).

I'm debating with myself.  Should I continue to work and hope to get severance package?  Or am I being stupid and selfish ?

Should I pay myself a lump sum or spread it out over 2 years?,"I run a business which I'm planning on closing. When it closes I will have 2 year's worth of my salary left in the account. I could just do an owner's draw and pay that money to myself, but thought it might be advantageous to pay myself every 2 weeks as I have been doing, then I can contribute to social security and my 401k.

Collecting SS based on XHs earnings - SSA won’t tell me how much?!,"My retirement investment advisor asked me to call SSA to find out what I will qualify for based on my XHs earnings. He always earned more than me and continues to. I’m 50; he is 51. 

They said they can’t tell me anything until he starts collecting, and I won’t have the option to collect based on his until he does, but if I start collecting before he does, then I will never be able to collect at the higher amount based on his income.

He and I are not in contact, so he will never tell me when he starts getting SS. They said all I can do is start calling them regularly once he turns 62 to find out after he starts collecting. 

So WTF?? How can I accurately plan for retirement without this info?

My monthly projection based on my income is $1000. They would not give me any information about his. Now what?"
Involuntarily retired today - time for reflection on the next phase of life,"Whelp, I knew it was a possibility, and today it happened. Went to work and was re-orged. I’m at that age where getting a similar paying job is highly unlikely, so I’m taking some time to figure out what’s next.

The good news is that I have zero debt, own my home and have a bit more than $1.2 M total, made up of 401k, IRA, HSA and a brokerage account. Plus I’ll get a severance package from my former employer. 

I’ve been lurking in this sub for some time, and I’d like to thank everyone who has shared their experiences so freely. I appreciate it and I’ve learned a ton from you all. 

Now it’s time for a glass of 18-year old scotch and a bit of reflection.

Edit: A number of commenters have inquired about my age. I’ll be 59 before the end of the year.

Also, included in the $1.2M figure mentioned above is a deferred compensation program that will pay out a bit more than $50k a year for the next 5 years.

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for the kind words of encouragement. I hope that as I progress on this journey that I can contribute to this community and help others half as much as you’ve helped me."
Has anyone had experience using a Vanguard Financial Advisor?,"Update: Thank you for the recommendations and sharing your experiences. I think I'm going to give them a try. I can always cancel if it doesn't work out, but with the comments received (for and against using them) I know what to expect and ask for. Again, thank you!

&#x200B;

When I retired about two and half years ago, I transferred my 457 and 401 retirement plan savings from the company my employer used to Vanguard. It automatically went into their money market fund to hold until I figured out where to invest it . At that time, the market was going down, and while my gains were minimal in the money market fund, I didn't lose anything in the downturn. It's time to start moving money. I thought about hiring a Vanguard Personal Financial Advisor, but I was hoping I could get some feedback from others who may have used them. They charge $30 per $10,000 invested. Thoughts? Thank you!"
Leveraging property value growth but cost to own is high,"I bought and remodeled a large beachfront condo in a desirable Naples FL area and have made this my residence for 7 months of the year. Timing of the purchase was good (late 2020) just before the price run up, although I could have paid cash, I took advantage of a 2.8% mortgage on 60% of the purchase price.  
  
The mortgage balance is now equal to about 25% of the unit value, a very nice situation. It’s great to benefit on the value growth of leveraged money but I wonder if it’s worth it as the ownership cost is high - annual mortgage P&I, HOA, insurance, assessments etc. are equal to about 3 or 3.5 % of the property value. (about 35% of my total annual spending)  
  
I’m drawing from retirement accounts as my income source and am not sure how smart it is to continue with the big annual ownership cash outlay, hoping to “pay myself back” if and when I take a big gain 10-15 years down the road.  
  
What am I missing as I try to determine what to do - stay put in the life of luxury hoping the beachfront growth “wave” continues, or get out, pay cash for a place far less expensive and significantly reduce my cost of living? Any suggestions or things to consider?"
Wife SS will be much lower than mine. Both of us will be 62 soon. Should she collect her SS then?,"As I understand it.

1) If one of us dies the other would continue with my larger SS anyway so I probably should wait for my SS to get larger where's hers would just go away if I died anyway.

2) If she collects her SS and I (not her) earn money but we file joint taxes, does the money I earn get taxed at 50% too (before 67)"

But what if I'm 63 years old, retired and exceed the $21,240 cap only this year?

Tryout moving to 55+ community to see if we fit in?,"I know from experience that things aren't always what they seem. The wife and I and our lab will retire Nov 1st. We live in a historic house (for 28 years) on a big road with no neighbors or friends in a HCOL area.  We are considering moving to an apartment in Lancaster, PA about 3 hours from our house. Our house is paid for but the upkeep is getting tough. In 3 years our taxes (about 10k) will get cut in half. The apartments (2 bedroom) are about 2600/mo. $2600 vs $1500 (for our home) which has high ceilings and big windows just like the apartments seems a little better deal to stay, other than the lack of friends. 

We found 2 55+ apartment buildings that would be nice, but am afraid to make the wrong move. I'd love to sublet a furnished apartment in one of those buildings for a month or two to see if we are compatible.

Pre-Retirement Surprise. Hope I am not the only one.,"I'm just gonna pat myself on the back.  After a little more than 10 years on this job, I have *finally* read some more chapters in our Employee Handbook.  I never bothered to read chapters that did not pertain to me, but now that I am planning to retire within the next year or so, it became clear that just maybe I should read the chapter on leaving the company.   Found out, that the year I retire, once I actively work the entire month of January, if I decide to retire anytime after Feb 1,  I will have earned ALL of my vacation days for the year.  I  have 6 weeks!  Well, whoever said ""reading is fundamental""  was right ... Hopefully I am NOT  the only one out there who had not read the employee manual.   "

Does one lose the state tax exemption when you purchase treasuries in an IRA brokerage account?,"Okay, I just realized I've probably been doing this wrong. Example: choice between a slightly higher interest CD versus a treasury note (in our Fidelity IRA account).

Annuity being pushed by financial advisor,"I plan on retiring at 59 1/2. I will be getting a pension and SS at 62. I plan on living off savings in the interim. I also have a very healthy 401k, and my financial advisor wants me to put about a 1/3 into an annuity. I don’t see a reason for this because my pension would act like an annuity when I start getting it. I also don’t want money in a vehicle that would just keep it should I die. I want to make sure any of my money goes to my beneficiaries. He said he would set up a portfolio for my 401k money, which is fine, but am not interested in an annuity.

We have planned well financially and our income will be a bit higher in retirement than while working, I'm just so tired of working hard but being able to afford so little in this place as mid-level government workers. I like the idea of finally affording the home I want. Is anyone familiar with the pros and cons of retiring in the Omaha area. My parents are not yet retired (aged 87) and everyone else there that I know is my age or younger and not retired, and none of them have lived elsewhere and have nothing to compare it to, so they aren't reliable narrators!"

"Interest rates should stay around 5% for longer — even as inflation falls, top economist Jim O’Neill says","[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/veteran-economist-jim-oneill-says-interest-rates-should-stay-around-5percent-for-longer.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/10/veteran-economist-jim-oneill-says-interest-rates-should-stay-around-5percent-for-longer.html)

It looks like the Fed might nudge rates up by a quarter point in September, but the real action could be a rate cut in 2024, as per CME Group's crystal ball. O'Neill's got a point – aiming for around 5% rates makes sense for keeping inflation in check and stability."
Help me! I cannot put decisions in a logical order.,"I lost my husband 2.5 years ago. I never took leave, then or when my mom died earlier this year, and my job has continued to ramp up in responsibility and stress. 

I am now burned out and thinking about retirement at 58. I am over invested in my job and the identity it gives me. At the same time, I see the clock ticking and want to transition to a different life.

My daughter tells me I have enough to retire if I live modestly. I have financial safety nets. 

How did you actually pull the trigger on retirement? What decisions (other than money) need to be considered? Why is it so hard that give up on work?

Using the Open Social Security website for making a decision for taking SS.,"I have found great utility in this website but have noticed a strange fact every time I use it.  People often join this subreddit to discuss/announce their SS plans, but based upon the information provided by the OSS website to me, I no longer see the point of planning at all.  Here is why I have come to this conclusion:

I am 62 and my spouse is 64.  Our plan was not to wait until FRA but instead, but to start taking at 65.  I input all of our info into OSS and get an interesting ""max"" payout.  My spouse should start taking SS immediately while I wait until 70.  I understand that this is estimated to be our max payout (100%). Using the ""Test an alternative claiming strategy"" farther down the page is where my eyes REALLY opened up to other possibilities.  This chart allows you to play ""what if"" with your when you take your SS.  I used this chart to determine that if we stuck by our original plan, our payout would be reduced by only about 3.5% (from the maximum) over our lives. In fact, if we push things a bit farther and take SS even earlier (say at 63) our benefits are only reduced by 4.6%.

Please chime in with your thoughts here.  If the OSS webite is to be trusted then all of our pondering about when to take SS ultimately comes down to a few percentage points. Also, taking SS earlier also guarantees that you will actually get something before we pass. One of my parents paid into SS for 25 years and died before collecting anything ...

Edit: I should have mentioned here, upfront, that this whole exercise is based upon someone wanting to maximize their LIFETIME benefit and not their monthly check.  This exercise did not consider monthly cash flow.

Looking for Opinions on Pension,"We meet with a financial planner tomorrow, but honestly, I wanted other peoples’ opinions.  I am an educator looking to retire in July 2024.  As it stands now, my teacher’s pension will be $1300/month beginning in August 2024.  I have the ability to purchase “years of experience” in my pension.  If I purchase 7 years of experience at a cost of $150,000, my pension goes up $1000 per month to roughly $2300/month.  I’d be pulling the money from an IRA (mutual fund) that has averaged 10% over the past 40 years.  My head tells me leave it in the mutual fund, but I’m also drawn to the fact of rolling the money into my pension and avoiding RMD taxes later in life.  Thoughts?"
Planning to file for SS today...,"Couple age 64 in September.

The Plan is that IRA investment withdrawal rate @4% plus SS equals our current lifestyle.  We are living well, but not crazy over the top.  So the income plan is good.

Wife has her own work history where her monthly benefit is more than 50% of mine until age 69 where it is about equal.

So the way I see it..  delaying my filing would push our current withdrawal rate higher than I like.   Especially since we are still coming back from the last couple years of rough ride.

 If I die first, her own SS will be good.  If she goes first, I am fine too.  So I am not so concerned about survivor benefits.

 Sequence of returns tells me to take the SS and let the qualified plans roll and get  long term returns from the current investments.   Maybe some room for Roth conversions down the road too.. 

Any counter thoughts?"

Prepping for retirement at 64,"Where is my community?

I am planning to leave my federal position at the end of Oct. And I am wondering about how retirement is going to work out socially. I don't have any friends at work. All of my coworkers either retired or got promoted. I also came down with renal cancer and so far it looks like I am a survivor (it's been 18 months).

When I stop my federal gig I am talking to a co in my field about doing 20 hours week, pre inspecting submissions to the govt. But I have no close friends outside of work. We live in a 108 year old house and have no neighbors. How do I find my community? I don't do religion and am pretty liberal. Me and the wife who already stopped working pretty much watch TV from 4.30 to 9pm when I go to sleep. We use to like wine, but I had to stop due to my health. I use to like hiking with my dog, but in my weakened state am severely limited in that. 

I am also a software developer and wrote an app I am trying to get on AWS so I am an entrepreneur. Not successful yet. I play jazz guitar with a small band about 2 hours/ week.

Switch from Medicare N to Medicare G?,"I'm trying to decide between Medigap N and Medigap G.

My understanding is that the difference between them is Excess Charges.

I'm in Massachusetts right now, which does not allow Excess Charges, so Medigap N would make more sense.

But in a few years, I'll probably move to another state, but I don't know which state. Most states allow Excess Charges. So when I move, I'll probably want to have Medigap G instead.

How hard is it to switch from Medigap N to Medigap G?

When I move from one state to another, I'll have to change my Medigap to another company anyway, right? What would happen if I had a preexisting condition at that point in time?

Does it make more sense to switch from N to G when I need it? Or should I just sign up for G now?"

Americans are pulling money out of their 401(k) plans at an alarming rate,"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/08/economy/401k-hardship-withdrawals/index.html

This is not meant to be a political topic, so please don’t get this one locked like the 26 upvote one from yesterday.

I post this because it bodes ill for the future of the stock market.  And it may affect your retirement investment choices going forward.

I see two factors here: 

1) This is money going out of the market.  It is not boosting demand for stocks, but the opposite.  

2) The economy has been buoyed by consumer spending.  With the amount of credit card debt at all time high, high(er) mortgage rates deterring refinance (cash out), and now people pulling from their retirement accounts, we may be nearing the end of how well the consumer can keep it up.

The market may be heading downward already.  It’s only about a week, but the red ink is dwarfing the green.  The bears are getting air time on CNBC."

Walkable US cities for a retired parent?,"I’m looking to purchase a property for my 70 yo retired mother. The property would need to be less than $400k.

A college town would probably be best seeing as it could be an investment property down the line, but it’s not a dealbreaker. Any suggestions?

Learning a language late in life?,"Hello, all.  I hope your day is going well.

I retired last fall, and am now 60.  I’ve been thinking about learning a new language, probably Spanish, but am a little intimidated about taking this on at my age.

My wife and I like to travel internationally, and I generally take the very American approach of assuming people abroad understand some English.  This has worked in the tourist areas of Italy, France and Mexico. But, I’ve always felt guilty that I was being rude and so want to try to gain at least conversational language skills for basic interaction while traveling.

Have any of you learned a language in retirement?  How did it go, and are there any tips, tricks or recommendations you can share?  I spent my career in engineering, but was not required to take language in high school and my university allowed us to take Fortran to satisfy the language requirement (yes, Fortran.  I’m old.).

Anyway, I’d appreciate any experiences you may be able to share about learning a language after 60.  Thanks!

Edit:  Thank you for all of the thoughtful and encouraging responses!  It’s great to hear about the new  languages you are learning and the many resources you have used.  The experiences you have shared have made me very excited to get started!"
What age does your retirement plan go to?,"One of the first questions in planning is what age to plan to.

COBRA 60-day grace period,"Need some COBRA advice. 

I gave my notice of retirement to my company last week (so excited!). My last day of employment will be Friday Oct 6.  I am 59 so not eligible for Medicare.  

My understanding is that I have 60 days after my last day of employment to opt in or out of COBRA.  I am planning to wait out this period and not schedule any routine doctor's visits.  If I get to the end of the 60 day period without any urgent health issues requiring an ER or doctor's visit, then I can reject COBRA and basically get  2 months of free health insurance (Oct 7 - Dec 7).  I'll need to buy temporary health insurance (emergency coverage) to bridge me to December 31, then my ACA coverage should kick in on Jan 1st.

Maybe trips to see family and friends and enjoy those cities. But we're also good with AirBNB weeks in the mountains of Maine or the woods of Alabama or the high country of New Mexico. We really don't need anything exotic or pricey. But that's just us. What about you? What are your plans?"

Roth 401k withdrawal questions,"I've seen conflicting information on Roth 401K withdrawals.  Hoping the community here knows or can point me to a place,   I am starting to plan the deaccumulation plan.  It is much harder than the accumulation plan to me.  My situation:

Roth 401K was started in 2020.  I am utilizing a backdoor Roth in-plan conversion.  I make over the Roth IRA limits so can't open a Roth IRA right now.  I max out the pre-tax 401K contributions.

I am 58 and planning to retire no later than 12/31/2025 (I'll be 60.5 at that point).   When can I take Roth w/ds tax free?  Do I have to wait until I can open/rollover into a Roth IRA and then wait 5 years?  Or can I take them as soon as I retire in 2025 since I'll be over 59.5 and it will be 5 years in the 401k?

Thanks.

6 months from retirement. Two big purchases coming. HELOC or cash?,"Retirement in 6 months. Pretty okay set up. House paid for, 1.3 mil in IRA, $1900 rental income and $4900 SS starting  in May 24. (Me and wife). 

We are building a screened in porch ($35,000) and I need a new vehicle ($50,000) in the next few months. 

My question is should I spend my $90,000 after tax cash for both, literally going to zero, 
Or should I get a HELOC and let my house buy me something and hold onto my cash?

I’m in the latter camp because I sleep better knowing I have cash, but with HELOC rates pretty high, I’m not sure. 

Thoughts?"
Please ELIF5 universal life insurance and if I should be looking into it for my mom,"Hello, my mom who is 70, has AIG's universal life insurance. The policy amount is $100,000 and she's been paying $87/month ever since she got it 17 years ago. She used to have a term policy, but I was a dummy and didn't know what I was talking about and said she change her policy. I deeply regret this.

She threw away any original forms and documents that she would have received when she opened it (I don't know why). I've contacted AIG to mail us a copy of any documents or pamphlets explaining the policy but all they sent back was a single document breaking out how much she's paid, cash value, surrender value, etc. I've also called asking to explain what the policy is and it was not at all helpful.

I've read online that universal life policies are bad and trying to understand the point of them, but all I can understand is that they're much more expensive than term, maybe targeted for high earners? (my mom is not even middle class), and that the premium paid earns an interest.

Questions:

1. Could someone kindly ELIF5 what a universal life insurance policy is?
2. What happens to the cash value that is earning interest? Because when she passes, isn't it the $100,000 that gets paid out?
3. It's too late for her to get a term policy, but should I be worried that she has a universal policy?
4. Should I be checking on her policy and asking AIG any questions, or anticipate something that I'm not aware of?

I appreciate any info or advice. Thank you.

Do you have to actually be 55 to use the rule of 55?,"So if I turn 55 in August, does that mean I can use the rule of 55 and retire on January 1st of that calendar year I turn 55 even though I'm not technically 55 yet until August?"

One thing that confuses me is how best to handle sinking funds for estimated expenses that may not happen every year (i.e. I know real estate taxes and car insurance have hard payment dates each year so I'd pull ""X"" dollars a month and put it in savings).  I'm talking about things like a monthly amount put aside as a sinking fund for ""home maintenance"" or ""car maintenance"" that you never know when you will need it.  Is it best to withdraw those estimated amounts monthly along with the normal expenses to build a pot of cash or keep the money in the portfolio and pull it out lump some if you need to tap it?  Best practice?

How many will not be able to fully retire?,"Being self-employed and have had some life events, I know I will likely work my blue collar job until I die.

I try to eat better and take care of myself.
My wife has her elderly parents which we take care of, but once they're gone, it's just her sibling who lives in another state.

I'm working hard to put some money in good investments etc. But I know I will like have to do some type of work until I die. But I'm hoping my sacrifice, will allow my wife to have a stable non-work life in her remaining time on earth.

A lot less stressed about retiring,"If you remember a month of so ago, I asked about retiring - well, semi-retiring, and working 3 days for the next few years  
Yesterday, I got my social security statement - I've NEVER counted on it.  What I have in the bank is what I have.  Opened my eyes more than a bit.  If I wait till Dec 2024 to collect (have to anyway), and figuring the 4% rule, my income will be greater than my gross for the last year where I've been on partial layoff, and I won't have a mortgage, and I'll be living in a lot less expensive area of the country (and there is an addition bunch from an old employer - another almost 1K/month)

Being the one with the finances - relationship advice?,"So you've scrimped and saved and now you are free to travel.  (my not too distant dream along with starting new projects).

I think you need to be hardline the one to set the budget to avoid the nagging ""...can we spend just a little  more? .. a little more?"" which the disrespect would end a relationship quickly for me.   Being a business owner and provider I've seen how quickly it gets turned around on you, providing wonderful opportunities for people and how that turns into you owing them more and more all the time.   In working relationships with limited other options, you sometimes put up with that.   In my personal life, it's not happening, I'm too experienced in how it poisons relations (at least my interest), but people are people and greedy they are so you mustn't give too much.   Of course ""find a partner who pays her own way"" is the easy solution, that's not the question I'm asking.

Update to Homeowner Insurance Saga,"A  little summary of [what happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/158akod/home_insurance_premium_skyrocketed/) that I posted last week.  I got a renewal for my home insurance  that practically doubled the premium from last year's. The insurance  company that I have been with for the past 20 years (always was the  lower if not the cheapest premium) refused to lower the estimated  rebuild cost of my $480k home from $1.12M.  I started my search for a  new one.  What I found out is that the insurance companies have a ""home  estimated replacement cost tool"" that spits out a rebuilt price based on  the make up of your home (based on the data on the realtors database  ... usually what was submitted to the county/state for property tax  appraisal).  Several insurance companies provided quotations based on a  range of $630k - $750k to rebuild our house (aka dwelling) and not  $1.12M.  They then would take that cost and provide a quotation or quote it up  to an additional 20% if they want to (according to one), plus any  inflation factor (in addition to what's built in their calculator) they'd like to include. The rest of the coverage  (personal property, personal liability, dwelling extension, etc..) is  based on the ""dwelling"" estimate.

I finally settled with  combining my home/auto/flood/umbrella with my current auto insurance  agency. This provided me with a slight increase of 7.6% over what I paid  last year on everything.

Lessons learned (for US based folks):

1. Do  your homework and make sure that you understand the makeup of your  premiums (be it home, auto, flood, etc...).   Here is a good primer on [homeowners insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance-guide/).   It is not like investment where all you do is to contribute and  forget.  If you pay and forget (auto-renew), you may have your premium  increased without knowing.
2. Also,  bundle your insurances, they will give you additional discount(s).   That's one mistake I made, thinking that since my auto insurer got out  of the home insurance a few years ago, I didn't check back.  I'm glad  that I did.  Even though my home insurance company has maintained a  decent premium for me through the years, they hold no loyalty. None of  them do.  Once you filed a claim, your premium will go up. So, we should  not hold the same loyalty (my bad).
3. If  you don't want to do the search yourself, look at a reputable broker or  independent insurance outfit who will do the search for you.  I have  several friends who have had great luck with their broker/independent  insurance company.  I did not try them this time due to the short fuse I  had to renew. I will have to dig further to see how these brokers  and/or independence react when you need them.
4. Always  ask to see how you can save on the premium.  Ex: if you have umbrella,  then you don't have to carry that high of liability portion on home,  usually the lowest that umbrella requires you to.
5. Do  consider umbrella, especially at our age/situation where we do have  asset exposure. Young people will bounce back if they get sued, but  it'll be harder for us.  It's a debatable issue.  This maybe where 401k  and in some states IRA are protected from debtors.
6. Start the process early. It will take a while.  I thought I knew, but apparently, I didn't.

Please add any tips, tricks, traps, or experience with brokers/independent insurers that you have had.

Cheers,

Need help turning a hobby into a low-key way to make a little money after early retirement.,"I (59M) had to retire a little over a year ago due to a medical issue. I have a small retirement fund and with my wife's income we're OK financially, but I'd like to make a little side money just so I feel like I'm contributing a little and I probably just need something to do.

I love to tinker, and I've been maintaining my vehicles and yard equipment my entire adult life and I've gotten pretty good at it. I've fixed lawn mowers, trimmers, generators, etc. as favors for friends and family for years so I'd like to try my hand at making a few bucks from it. I posted some ""ads"" on Facebook Marketplace and the Nextdoor app, and did take a few calls with success, now I'd like to expand a bit more but not start an actual ""business"".

I'd greatly appreciate any advice from someone who's done something similar to this. Are there better ways to advertise? When do I have to start worry about taxes from the income? Things like that.

I know I can find out about a lot of this online, and I have done a plenty of research, but I like to get real world advice from the been-there done-that folks and Reddit has always been a good venue for that. TIA for any input.

Timing to give inheritance to adult kids?," Inspired by the book ""Die with zero"", we are beginning to wonder how our 8M+ net worth at this age (early 50s) could really help our kids (in their early 20s) without compromising our retirement.

Most people likely include their asset distribution as part of the WILL and inheritance is distributed after both spouses are dead when the adult kids are already likely to be in their 50s or 60s. The book advocates distributing this inheritance for the most part during much younger age (26 - 35 years) of the children so that they can actually benefit from it throughout most of their adult lives. On the other hand, most retired people may not be comfortable parting with their hard earned savings too early only to realize that they may end up needing some of it later.

How are you all handling it and what are some of the pros and cons for your strategy? I understand that we don't need to work hard so that we can save for kids' to inherit our money. However, it is inevitable that many in this group and other categories may have assets that will be worth more than our need. This is a question for that group."
Medicaide & Asset Protection,"I'd like some help and someone to point me to solid online advice please (don't know who to trust). Very much appreciative of any help anyone can provide.

# Background

Married couple. > 65. One spouse has (relatively) early onset Alzheimer's and needs to move to memory care asap (no chance of waiting 5 years). Current assets are around 700K spread across many asset classes (details below).

This isn't a ""_how do I screw the government_"" question but rather how does one get what they are entitled to, pay what is expected, and preserve some amount of assets for the surviving spouse?

# Qualify

How does one qualify for Medicaide? How does one demonstrate what assets one has? Who does this?

Once qualified, do you have to ""requalify"" year after year? I.e. what if the non-claiming spouse starts to work again or her children give her a gift?

Are the Medicaide rules different by state or the same for everyone?

# Assets

_NOTE_: I understand the 5 year look back rule.

What assets can a surviving spouse expect to keep?

Can annuities be attached? Does it matter which spouse is the beneficiary of the annuity?

Can whole life policies be preserved or do they have to be cashed out at face value?

Do rental properties have to be sold or is just the income claimed by the government?

Is social security taken away? For both spouses or just the claiming spouse?

What protections are left in place so that the non-claiming spouse has ongoing income and does not have to live destitute?


# Allowable Asset Protection Strategies

Could they buy a new car?

Could they do upgrades or repairs (new roof, new furnace for example) to their house?

Could they legally divorce?

Could they buy a new and more expensive house to shield some assets?

Am I correct that annuities, irrevocable trusts, gifting, etc are all essentially going to just be unwound if they are performed in the look back period?

What are the normal things people do in this situation (as opposed to the gray area or illegal things)?

If the other spouse works, is it just wasted effort if the government is simply going to claim assets anyway?


**EDIT** 

Disclosure that couple is MIL/FIL. MIL has refused to act/face reality but recently FIL is abusive tending towards violent. MIL is still reluctant to fully commit to a plan. As Alzheimers tends to be somewhat hereditary (already taking grandparents and uncles), there is also a concern for the future generations.

Estimating costs in retirement,"Looking for a sanity check. Live in Austin, so MCOL/HCOL boundary. Own home outright, taxes and insurance ~8k/yr. Two cars, no loans, one 2 yrs old, one 16 yrs old. I expect our outlays for Medicare & supplementals will be $325 each/month. I like to cook, but we eat out fast food 1x/wk and sit-down food 1x/wk. No expensive hobbies like golf or skiing or rebuilding cars. We may travel domestic 2-3x/yr, and no big plans for overseas trips.

I have taken an online course to become “board qualified” but I’m not really sure if that’s worth anything.  There are lots of “LinkedIn” type of placement services online that claim to be able to get you a board seat, but they all appear to be scams (charge you lots of money but then nothing happens, at least that’s what it appears like from reviews).  I know I won’t likely get a board seat on a large company, but surely some (small/medium size) company could use my help?

Edit for additional information:

First, thank you for all the feedback.

For context, the Company I work for is a statewide organization with roughly 1,500 employees and 650M in revenue.   I have been good about succession planning and have good people in the wings.

However, my Board is very political as they are elected and not appointed.  I think the majority will be fine with the people in the wings, but there is a vocal minority that thinks we should go outside. ( Ever met anyone who reads every management book, and thanks that's how you run a company).

Without trying to overinflate my contributions, I was a significant factor in a turn around.  However, it's left me tired and burned out. My post here was to try and gauge if  it was too soon to formally announce.  

I am not worried about being let go, I have 21 years of service and a good relationship.  But, with the politics, I am trying to make sure I have enough time to install my successor, and if it goes sideways, can help find someone from the outside."
I think I am hitting a wall,"I am 58 and the job is just not doing it for me, but I don't see a way to move my life forward. I have a huge house filled with 30 years of clutter. I have a stack of financial tasks I have not been able to get to because I work too much. And yet, I can't imagine the day without work. I'm terrified of losing my income. I don't know how to get insurance. When I think about figuring it out, my brain seizes up and I get nowhere. 

What is the FIRST step to really retiring? Did you quit first? Reduce your hours? Downgrade your job? Sell your house? How can I untangle the giant ball of crazy that is my current life?

**Edit to add:** I am a recent widow and my daughter is my trust executor. She assured me I have the money to retire now if that's what I want to do. This is not about finances. I realize that puts me in a privileged position and I'm grateful for that, but I'm wary of quitting my job and being in total emotional free-fall, especially after the death of my husband."
Best US States to Retire for Taxes?,"I know I had this question for our retirement planning - which states are better for retirees from tax angle. Just found this link from Vanguard's website and thought it could be helpful to others so sharing it here.

Edit/Clarification: Some are correctly pointing out that for them taxes don't matter or that taxes are only a small part of the retirement planning considerations. It may be worth nothing for some, I understand. There are so many possible factors to consider other than the taxes and for each of us it may vary. My post is just to share some useful information for anyone who thinks this data point is useful in their planning. If not, that's fine too.

Pre-retirement Senioritis,"It kinda seems like, ever since I identified my expected retirement date (a year and a half+ from now), I’ve started showing an advanced case of senioritis at work.  I spend a certain amount of time isolating in my office scrolling around on my phone.  I’m in healthcare, and I’m still doing very good direct care work, but I’m having a VERY hard time performing my administrative responsibilities.   I feel tormented that I can’t make myself do them, and that it may negatively affect others. 

I’d retire sooner, but I need to finish paying off some debt before I do.  That’s another topic that I spend my day obsessively calculating, checking my projected progress, etc.   Does anyone have suggestions?  Can you relate?  Help!"

Home Insurance Premium Skyrocketed?,"Has your home-owner insurance (in US that is) skyrocketed this year?  In Houston, our house was appraised by the county at $480k and the surrounding homes sold between $500k-$650k.  I just got our renewal premium back and it went from $3800 to $6500!  They indicated that it will cost them $1.12M to rebuild our house from scratch!  I know that inflation went up and went back down, but a 71% mark up?  Wow, talking about unexpected surprises! I have been with the same ins company for the past 21 years! They usually are cheaper. (Yes, I'm checking with other insurance companies now.)

Edit:  Thanks for all the replies.  I am checking and other ins company set the rate at a reasonable $632k -$700k for total rebuild of the dwelling.  My old insurance has been relatively cheap and responsive up until now.  I heard it through the grapevine that they wanted to get out of the home-owner insurance and just staying with auto.  I talked to them and they said that their underwriters indicated that it will cost $1.12M to rebuild our house from ground up and they don't go according to sales price nor appraised price.  They won't budge.  It looks as if we will part ways!

I agree with the statements that this is the effect of the claims ... but from all over and not just Texas.  In Houston area, the last major floodings/hurricanes were 2015, 2016, 2017 (Harvey), and 2019 ... of course the Snowmageddon of 2021.  I figure that the recoup of these should have been factored in already (it has been steadily going up).  Thus nothing happened 20-23 that would have hit insurance companies pocket in Houston area, unless it is the payout for the tornadoes, flood, hurricanes, fire, etc (all except brimstones ... although the constant 100 degrees lately feel like it LOL!) ... throughout US!  this is just another unknown expense that we all have to factor into our retirement plan."
Medicare and health plans at 65/Getting ready to retire,"64(M) who's 65th birthday is next May (2024).  From reading here, I see I need to sign up for Medicare during a 7-month window (3 months before - birth month - 3 months afterwards) or pay a penalty in forever higher Medicare rates?  My wife still has a few years to go before retirement and could take family plan health insurance out (we both have individual policies at our own workplaces now).  A family plan would be several hundred dollars more than we are paying now.  Does the availability of her insurance make any difference to me?

What do I need to do before retiring?  Am I missing anything else?

Thanks for any info/advice"
How can I analyze pros and cons of buying a QLAC?,"Is there a calculator out there for this?  We’ve got $120K income annually between SS ($88K, $55K me, $33K spouse) & pensions ($32K, no cola, both 100% survivor). Annual nut $60K.   Own home outright, one low cost car.  All parents lived into deep 80’s without trying.  We’re both healthy 69 yo’s.  Modest 401K, $300K, so it’s not a ton of money if we do the QLAC but there are some savings from a reduced RMD (at least until we collect the QLAC). I’m risk averse so it kind of appeals to me.  Thoughts?"

Waiting for 67 to draw ss,"I am looking at retiring from my job at 65 which is at the end of October. But I am getting nervous. My wife's and my ss will be about 4.2k per month. I also will have a 22k/yr pension. And perhaps a 24k/year inherited property income. We also have about 1.2M but that is about 50% in an inherited IRA.

My job pays 150k/yr but we live in a hcol area.  Tax on our owned house are about 11k/yr.
I have cancer but it seems under control. My job has turned into sh.t. and my employer is transferring me to a different job because of my reasonable accomodation. They didnt ask me.

That lack of respect for a longtime employee  is an embarrassment. I am trying to get a part time job in my field so I can keep bringing in some $ so I can wait until 66.8 to draw ss.

Any advice on when to draw ss?"
Am I correct that my recently widowed mother (72) should be collecting 100% of BOTH hers and my later father's (74) SS?,My father passed recently. He and my mother were both over 66 and collecting SS at the time. As I best understand [survivor benefits](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/ifyou.html) my mother is entitled to 100% of what my father was receiving from SS. I'm unclear if she is entitled to that amount AND her own benefits of that amount OR her benefits.
Rent vs Own in Retirement- 60 years old,"We want to relocate to Providence and either rent or buy a condo. Should I take $100K out of my $200K IRA and buy a condo for $450K?

Why would anyone (office worker) retire naturally when they can go into “quiet quit mode” until a severance package is presented?,"And then qualify for unemployment benefits?

Retirement planning calculations based on current short term interest rates,"I have seen a few different comments on various posts across different retirement related subs where people are basing some financial projections based on 5% interest rates in saving accounts. 

I am not a financial planner or anything like that but with my own experience, I would like to share this. While this current high interest rate environment yields approx 5% in HYSA, it is not likely to last forever. It was not too long ago that even 1% interest in our bank accounts and CDs was considered too high.

So someone suggesting that entire net worth invested in some bank CDs will net approx 5% annual income over 30 years sounds very risky and probably not correct. If the investments were diversified and someone is talking about stock market index fund netting approx 5% annually over the long term, it is more reasonable. 

Just my two cents and hope that people planning for themselves or people helping others in providing feedback on their plans consider this."
"If you moved in retirement, how did it effect your finances?",One possible way to stretch retirement funds is to move. Maybe it is to a lower cost of living area.  Move in with family. Perhaps downsizing to a rental or less expensive home. What was your experience on the finances?
Life insurance questions please,Can anybody give me advice on buying life insurance? Is this the correct forum? I’m 55 years old looking to cover cost of cremation and maybe a little more. 50k either term or whole. Need premiums under 200 a month. Is this possible? Any and all advice welcome.
SSA and highest 35 years of earnings,"Hi all - I've looked at the very helpful calculators that everyone here has linked to (thanks!). I have kind of a dumb question - from what I can see from the calculators there are 2 factors involved - accumulation of 35 highest earning years \*and\* when SS benies are actually taken.

I plugged in 35 years worth of super high numbers - well above SS max- and then plugged in the retirement ages - 62, 67, 70. Even with the crazy high numbers - taking SS at 62 still resulted in a much lower SS benefit.

So my question is if I stop working at 62 (which I might like to) but  didn't actually draw SS until 67 or 70 I'd get that higher benefit based on the 35 years of no zeros and relatively high earnings and not the lower amount correct?  TIA!"
Need help in determining how much in taxes I should have with held for my Social Security retirement payments,How do I determine how much to withhold on my monthly SSI. This will be the first year that I receive benefits starting in September.
SS or IRA-ROTH first at retirement? Other scenarios.,"58 and wanting to retire at 62/63.

At that point I will (unless something happens) be debt free.

I live a very frugal life (Thanks Clark). Realizing lots could change in the next 4/5 years but hoping for the best.

Trying to decide on drawing SS at 62/63 or use the amounts I have in my IRA, 401K, Roth first. The IRA, 401K, Roth should carry me comfortably for 3 or 4 years, then plan to start drawing SS at 65/67 unless those funds carry me further. I have used the online calculator on the SS website to confirm what I would draw at the aforementioned years.

As always, one big question is insurance. I've seen some posts elsewhere but not sure about this as I have a unique situation. I am on older ""single"" dad. For taxes, I claim one of our children and she claims the other (as most do in that situation). I have heard/read that since I will have a child under 18 when I retire at 62/63, I will get a break in cost for government healthcare until I can get on medicare at 65.

Questions:

1 - Does anyone have experience or knowledge of the situation with retiring  and government healthcare cost given I will have a child under 18. (side note, will insurance for the child be cheaper through the ACA for those reasons)? She may add them to her ins since I have had them on mine all these years. Time for her to take over but she may push back so looking for options for the kids.

2 - Should I draw as I mentioned above, from my retirement accounts then SS or SS first? I feel like I could draw more a month using my retirement accounts and live more comfortably those few years than if I started drawing SS at the lesser amount.

3 - Go ahead and start drawing at 62 and supplement with my retirement accounts as needed?

4 - Let's assume I do retire at 62/63 and start drawing from my retirements. At that time, should I convert all of my IRA and or 401K to the Roth account?

Also of note, I CAN NOT sit around and do nothing. I will at the point of retirement have 35 years in at my job. Plan on at least part time, 2 to 4 days a week doing something.

Side notes: Both parents died young / 47 and 50. 2 siblings died young 55 and 64. Not very inspiring but I don't want to base my longevity on their lifestyles etc. I'm fairly healthy.

Any thoughts or input would be greatly appreciated.

Has anyone ever done any adjunct teaching after retiring?,Does the school provide the course work or is it completely up to you?
Luxury of living in LCOL areas,"The more that I read the posts here, the more grateful that I am to be born in, and living in, a LCOL (St. Louis area). Some people post that they are not confident that they can retire on a total monthly income of $7,500-10,000. My wife and I (59 and 60) could live comfortably on $4K a month. I don't know that we could consistently spend $5K a month.  Admittedly, our house is paid off, and we have fairly simple tastes (rarely eat out--by choice--no expensive hobbies, etc.), but I am still amazed at how easy it is to live in a LCOL compared to a HCOL area. Our biggest single expense is the premium on our ACA-subsidized health insurance policy, and of course the subsidy scales to our income.

People can say what they want to about ""flyover country"" but it definitely has its advantages when it comes to paying the bills."
Financial Management in Retirement,"I would like to ask for guidance since my spouse will retire in a few years:

1. For those who have retired, are you using active management for your investment in equity and bonds? How would you think the result using them, has it been higher/better yield, especially during the downturn such as 2008, 2022. 
2. Did you use Financial Planner to work with you before pulling the trigger to retire? I have been managing my own financials for years, but I may miss some important things. 
3. I am wondering how Medicare works. Which would you suggest on both cost and service wise, Medicare Advantage or Medigap? We are in Southern California, if it location would make a difference. 

Thank you. "
Early retirement and resulting affect on Social Security benefits,"I'm currently planning and on track to retire early. One concern I haven't been able to address is my social security benefits. I can see my estimated payout on [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov), but I believe that assumes I work until at least 62.   


With your top 40 (correct?) earning years going into the calculation, I am going to have a lot of zeros in there due to early retirement. I am concerned how much this is going to affect my payout.   


Does anyone have a good resource to help me estimate my benefits? I have looked but did not find anything satisfying.  


These benefits will not come in to play for a long time, but I would like to have a better estimate of what I can expect when I claim benefits."
Go with younger professionals,"Quite a few years ago It was recommended to me by my nephew, a dentist, to find younger medical professionals. He stated that I did not want to be going on Medicare and/or retiring at the same time as my PCP, dentist, ophthalmologist, and others were also retiring. I followed his advice as well as going with a younger CFP. 
I have no regrets as all is working out so far. 
I am slightly worried that when and if I retire and move that I will have to start from scratch in finding new professional(s). Has anyone else changed out their professional choices or worried about having to do so as they enter/ entered retirement? May you find good fortune  in whatever you decide."
Medical exams to take using company insurance prior to retirement?,"So we're still on course towards retirement in about 32 months (986 days, but who is counting). While I'm still covered under decent company medical insurance what should we have checked/done prior to moving to (first) ACA and then Medicare+supplemental? I've already scheduled some dental work (Invisaligns), a full skin check, and colonoscopy (I'm slightly higher risk). What else would you/did you do before losing the company benefit? Are there specific things to consider by gender? TYIA and have a great day!"
International Portfolio Allocation,"It seems as if every book and article I read about portfolio allocation, or advisor (robo or human) recommends international funds.  I've never had much luck with them and I'm curious if other folks bother to include international funds in their retirement portfolios.  

This is Vanguard specific, but I assembled a list of their international equity mutual fund offerings and it really doesn't look all that appealing.  

My thinking is that any large company on the US exchange is already doing international business so I have exposure to those markets baked in to my portfolio already.

I'm including the S&P500 index fund as a comparison and I've sorted by 10Y, 5Y, 3Y, 1Y returns.

How did you feel once you retired?,"I am two years from retirement (I will be 65), but I think just pulling the plug will be a shock to my system, going from working 40 hours a week to suddenly nothing. For this reason I am hoping to taper off.... 4-day week for a year... 3-day week for a year... then pack it in.

What did you do? What did you try? What worked for you?"

Advice for my retiring parents,"My parents are asking for my advice how to handle their financial picture and I'm not sure I have easy answers for them. They haven't done as much to prepare for retirement as they could but they do have some assets. They are also thinking about moving so they can be closer to grand kids and not sure if they should rent or buy a condo and what they can afford:

Here's the situations for my parents, aged 67 and 66.  
Cash on hand = $212k  
Home equity = $250k  
Other assets = $10k  
Total monthly income from pension and SS = $4200  
Total monthly expenses = $5500 including $1k total from car loan and student loans  

My Mom has stopped working, my Dad continues to work part-time as a 1099 consultant and picks and chooses when and on what projects he wants to work. He plans to continue doing this but wants to plan a budget that does not depend on his employment. They also get a monthly royalty check from oil rights from the family ranch, but has not included this in the budget because they don't want to depend on it and it is variable and not guaranteed. Clearly their lack of planning/investing has hurt them, now they are left with depreciating cash and not enough cash flow. They have built the excess cash over the past few years, mostly from oil royalties, but at their close to retirement age were afraid to invest it in an uncertain market.  

Here some options:
1 -- Buy a condo closer to family with equity in current house. Keep some cash in checking and remainder in annuity at 5% return to generate monthly cash flow to satisfy budget.  
2 -- Rent a condo closer to family. Keep some cash in checking and remainder in annuity at 5% return to generate monthly cash flow to satisfy budget. Increased contribution to annuity offsets monthly rent cost.  

I know ""annuity"" is often a dirty word in PF but I'm not sure they have a better option in this case. What would you advise them to do?"
Community Update,"Hello! As some of you know, this subreddit was not moderated for a long time and did not have a clear focus. Looking out there in Reddit, it feels like traditional retirees don’t have a community of their own (at least for discussing finances). Now we do.

Here is the place for table talk. Like being at your table with friends and family while conversing over pie, hanging out with friends at the local pub, your weekly coffee klatch. We share our up&downs, discuss family and pets (they ARE our family), brag about getting a discount or those kids/grandkids, reflect back on our old careers and lifestyle, how things changed and our plans, and a big focus is discussing finances (see our in-progress wiki!). Many of us are now spending down savings or trying to navigate social security Or RMDs. Others are not quite at retirement and trying to figure it all out. And yes, we keep it civil so it is free of profanity, religion and politics. Bonus! It helps to keep our blood pressure down 😉

Who is this group for? Focused on 50 + year olds that are planning to retire and those who already retired, at the age of 59.5 on up.

Some times younger folks visit this sub for guidance, hopeful early retirees aim to get another set of eyes on their numbers, both seeking help and community. Thing is, they can go to places such as r/financialindependence or r/personalfinance and these dwarf us in  size. And if you did not already know there are some great subs for them to ask other questions and for us to answer,  titled,  ask old people 🙂 

Expect things to evolve!

The housekeeping items:

\- Articles and the like are nice to see but you also need to add some questions or point out items so we have direction for the conversation. We are not a newsfeed.

\-Some rules have been added. This is a starting point.

\-During this transition the sub will be closely monitored in order to get it more aligned. New folks or those with little karma are filtered on posting. We love having you but it will take time. Everyone can expect delays in actual posting and some posts and comments will be filtered. It might seem like watching the grass grow ...  I work and have a commute.

\-It will be an interesting start. New to moderating in Reddit and no idea how to do it on a cell phone.

\-This is a place for sharing. Anything shared should not be perceived as professional advice as this forum is for general knowledge.

And

Some of you might be struggling with depression or other mental illness. We encourage you to find appropriate care and online communities that are focused on this.

Thanks, Mid America Mom"
Applying for more credit?,"I’m planning to retire June 30, 2025 if all goes well. I’ll be 60, and while I may work part time after that for a little bit, I’ve decided that 2 more years is as much as I can stand. My job is high stress but annoying, and some recently imposed travel is killing my budget for pet boarding. When I think about it, 2 years really isn’t that long.

I received an offer from my bank for a credit card, and I went ahead and applied. Frankly, I don’t really need it; I probably have close to a $70k or so credit limit among all my cards now. But I started thinking that 1) credit will be harder to get once I quit my job and 2) that if I need credit for some future emergency, it’ll be nice to have. I don’t currently owe anything except about $120k on my mortgage, and the house is worth about $275k. I live in a LCOL city. 

I’m kind of thinking about applying for a HELOC, just in case. The plan would be to have it just in case of something catastrophic. 

Any downsides to having a bunch of credit you’re not really using? I’m also not worried about running up a bunch of credit bills at the end of my life—I have no heirs, so it doesn’t matter to me if I die with a bank balance of zero and a 100k in debt. But I’m not super spendy and I don’t see myself using any of the credit any time soon; I’m pretty sure I’ll have enough cash to cover most of the expected things to come up after I retire."

Low 401K Retirement - Will I be Ok?,"I get terrible retirement anxiety.  I DO NOT want to work forever but it feels like I will never have enough to retire.

How do normal people with a normal job, who really could not start saving when they were 20 years old do it?  

All these years I have been raising a family, going to school, paying off debt.  I will still have a house payment of $811. but I couldn't rent for less then that.  I could pay the house off in the next few years but then it would take a way from investing more.

6 months and everything just changed,"I was going to retire in six months at 59 1/2. And on my 59th birthday on Friday, I had a heart attack and coded twice.

I was hanging on for my December bonus and my end of year employee contributions and man that suddenly seems pointless.  The idea of rolling out of hospital bed and throwing myself back into a job. I no longer love with coworkers who don’t want to do the work and management who looks at me to pick up their slack… (they’re already looking forward to my return).  I’m gonna go on short term disability if not LTD.  AND, if that doesn’t work, I think I’m just gonna use up all my time off and then call it quits.

How to keep my sanity?,"My husband retired in May 2022. He decided to try a part-time job this spring. The job was not a good fit for him and he didn’t like the job. So second retirement was June 2023.

I feel like it won’t be a very hard transition. Probably not having the stress of getting up early will be different. I’m also not going to jump into volunteering to quickly. 

Thanks for any advice and tips. "
Want to Relocate but Worried About Elderly Parents,"I retired in Dec 2019. (Yeah, the timing sucked). We live in the southwest suburbs of Los Angeles and I've always wanted to live in the mountains. Husband is a General Contractor and the pandemic pretty much shut down his business. His business is why we stayed in our current home. He wants to stay retired.

The dilemma is I want to move. The husband is warming up to the idea. I know I would be a lot happier not living in the city but my elderly parents rely on me a lot. My mom is 90 and in ok shape. She gets tired easy and starting to have some minor memory issues. My dad is a s**t show. Morbidly obese, 50% blind and 50% deaf. Rarely leaves the house and controls all the finances. They do have a trust and POAs.

My older brother is encouraging me to do what is right for me. I feel like I'm abandoning my parents. I would feel more comfortable if they were in assisted living but they won't consider it.

Anyone else been in a similar situation? Would love some other perspectives and suggestions from this awesome community! TIA!"
"Retirees who are working part-time, is it because you have to, or want to? Explain.","I’m about to retire from a successful career in software product management. Though it’s been great, I want to do different things, choosing them because they sound fun, not because I need the money. (Though even minimum wage would make me feel I’ve got skin in the game.) Ideas I have include city tour guide, math and science tutor, set building for a local theater, front desk receptionist, tool department at Home Depot, interning at a cool engineering firm nearby, bartending, bookstore clerk. All must be part time or short gigs. If one gets boring I’d move on to the next. Anybody living this life?"
One week to go and kinda freaking out,"I will retire in a month and am having last minute seconds thoughts.  I have worked the numbers for months and am confident I can be comfortable on my $7,000 a month pension + medical but when I think that amount has to last me the rest of my life I start to freak a bit (I am only 55).  I will get COLAs of 1-2% starting in year three.  Did anyone else have cold feet near the end?  Did you change your mind? How did you deal with it?"
Best places to volunteer,"I've been retired now for 3 years, been playing golf, fishing, hunting, and going to the gym.  Kind of bored now and was looking for good ideas for places to volunteer my time.  Thanks."
Best way to update LinkedIn when I retire?,"I intend to work part time after I retire in a couple months, but not doing the kind of work I’ve been doing the last decade or so. I don’t want to slam the door by listing my role as Retired."
Should I Take A Pensioned Position That EXEMPTS Me From Social Security? (For The City)," My question is concerning pensions! I have an interview for a position with NO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WHAT-SO-EVER (and instead, a pension) I would put 8% of my pay into a pension fund and they would match that 8% with a 5% contribution. I would not pay social security taxes at all and my state would not allow me to collect SS when I retire. What do ya'll think about this? What worries me is the idea that if I leave working for the city, I would lose that 5% contribution (that the employer chipped in) and NONE of my time at this employer would count toward my social security retirement income. How does this make sense? Isn't paying into social security safer, because I can skip around employers and contribute to my retirement? Is this pension BETTER in any way to social security? 

&#x200B;

The role would be a raise in pay, although not a dramatic raise in pay. The health insurance is less expensive (which I do need, because I do have health issues) The position has NO chance of remote work which, my current position does have. (I can request to work remote whenever I'd like currently) But my main apprehension is giving up social security entirely. I dont know if this pension is better or worse than social security. It seems limiting. I would have to work for the city for 30+ years to retire with income..."

Who am I really looking for?,"I (53 M public school teacher) and my wife (52 F nurse) are trying to line up a retirement summer between 5 and 7 years from now. At age 60 I will qualify for a approximately 35k per year pension. This is perhaps the most relevant fact as we could probably live simply if very unspectacularly on that. We have a variety of investment vehicles cobbled together over the years. A few hundred k in a Roth here. A few more 100k and a 401b there. All said and done we probably have a net worth of $2 million, which is a combination of our investments over decades and a bit of inheritance.

I am quite comfortable navigating investing websites and carrying out any kind of transaction. My confusion comes about when trying to decide what type of expert we should be looking for. I really don't need someone to manage my money ( or maybe I do?)on a yearly basis especially for a percentage fee, but more of a tax advisor when it comes time to fund the first few years of retirement. Is this something that can be contracted for on an hourly basis or are they all going to look to have a percentage of invested funds?"
LTC policy,"Hi, I looked into a long term care policy. I am 55 and in good health (knock on wood). $100k investment. Day 1 benefit is $415,700 and age 80 is $870,384. Net worth is $2.5 million and I will be working for the next 2 years. Oh there’s also a death benefit which I personally don’t care about because I have no heirs. I think I can self fund if I need this (God forbid). And I’ve read stories on here of people who have it and can’t get paid out by the insurance company. Appreciate any unbiased thoughts. My financial advisor is pushing it hard."
Spend more when young,"If you knew that even if one spouse passed the absolute lowest your monthly income could go would be $6,000 with no mortgage payments, does it make sense to spend more from the other sources when under 70? This 4% withdrawal rate is to last for life, but if you also have that guarantee, does it make sense to spend more on travel the first ten years of retirement and just enjoy life? Is the 4% just a survival and inheritance thing?"
International Medical Insurance?,"I am relatively new to my Medicare coverage.  I have supplemental coverage via AARP/United Healthcare but internationally they only provide a lifetime max of $50,000 coverage for medical emergencies.  I will be traveling to France for 16 days in September and want to buy more medical coverage.  Any help appreciated….?"
Life insurance,"My wife and I are 63m/62f. I retired at the end of 2022. She still works full time as a realtor and will do so for several more years. Our one child is grown and married.  Our house, cars(2) etc. are all paid off.  Only debt we have is monthly expenses which is currently covered by her earnings. 

My question is do we need life insurance? We currently have a term policy on each of us and there is also a universal insurance on me. All we’re started when we were younger."
When to take profits,So the markets have been up for a couple of days. Once we get into a true bull market when do you guys take gains and put them into your cash bucket?
Need to rebalance but buying stocks now seems bad,"Hi all:

I'm 57 and I inherited a 403b in 2016 that I am currently taking RMDs from over my lifetime. When my father passed, the allocation was Moderately Conservative, part of it in stocks/bonds and part in the TIAA Traditional that guarantees a 4% return each year. Until recently, that was a good rate so although I want to keep the allocation at Moderately Conservative,  I've been taking my RMDs out of the stocks/bonds pro rata without touching the TIAA Traditional. My portfolio still grew and when the market dropped I only lost like 3% IIRC. So in this inherited account, I now have only 28% in stocks and 60% in the 4% guaranteed account. In my other retirement accounts, I am comfortable being more aggressive (50/50 stocks/bonds) because I don't plan to touch those til age 74. My taxable assets are currently in cash because I am on the fence on whether I want to buy a home.

The various financial analyses my TIAA advisor does for me shows that at this allocation I can still achieve my goals, but they still do recommend I rebalance if I want to be Moderately Conservative, which I do. I plan to take my RMD this year out of the TIAA Traditional. My only hesitation is that it's the only thing that's growing my portfolio right now. So it feels like a catch-22.

I guess my question is: is this a no-brainer, forget about the returns and fix the allocation to Moderately Conservative and over time it will be fine? TIA."
Traditional IRA Question,"Hello Reddit!  I have a traditional IRA that I put after tax money in manually at the beginning of the year.  I don't get any deductions from it on my taxes but I've been learning more about traditional vs Roth IRAs, and I don't want to get taxed later in life when I pull from it.  IIRC, TurboTax says I cannot deduct it because I also have a 401k through my employer.

Am I okay to leave it alone since the money in it has already been taxed or do I need to try to convert it?"

2 Cents on Retirement Plan Questions,"If you are going to ask this sub about your retirement plan or how much you need to retire,

**do include your** scientific wild-a\*\* guess (swag) ***annual retirement expenses*** (including health, travel, long term care, funeral expenses, gifts, taxes, leaving inheritance, kept wo(man), pets, etc.).

Take what you are currently paying (spent) and then subtract anything that you won't be paying (spending such as mortgage, kids, ex-wife/husband, etc.) during retirement!  If nothing else, take a guess if you have no clue!

If you choose to ask nose-bleed question and only provide your savings, you'll get what you'll get. Ex:

""I have $X Millions in 401k/cash/brokerage, house is paid for, a pension, am I ok to retire?""  The first thing that you'll get is:

\- What is your expense?

or

\- Yeah, retire already!

or

\- Are you serious?

Because **NO ONE** knows how fast or slow you will chew up your savings and/or retirement income!  Only you will know!

If you are worrying about providing numbers and someone will track you down through Reddit and hack into your portfolio account, let me know! 'Cause you know more about cybersecurity than meets the eyes!

Cheers

Edit: Need some help with the expense categories that you may want to consider, [see this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/comments/14p6kgv/retirement_budget_categories/)!

Edit 2: Oh yeah, read a bit on retirement planning, Roth, 401k, pension, etc., first! See our [Wiki Tab](https://www.reddit.com/r/retirement/wiki/index/) for resources galore!"
Ability to Retire - NEVER?,"Greets. I (60F), single now, divorced in 2018. Rented out my basement for 2 years to pay for my Masters degree (I know this is an old age to seek another degree but, I hadn't been in the labor force for some 12 years as a SAHM for our one and only child which I had at 42, so, I needed to upgrade my professional toolbox and this was my only realistic option. I didn't take out any student loans and the airbnb-traveling nurse thing paid for my degree so, I dodged a financial bullet there.)  I currently have a job earning $80k in a stable industry, but have only worked there for one year. It's a pretty high stress environment (it's an investor-owned startup) but some of the stress is self-imposed; my boomer tendencies to not honor work-life balance (what is that, anyways?!) have me pretty maxed out in every way. I get up, go to work, work all day, come home, check in on my 86 year old mom (who is now living in my basement) and my 18 year old daughter (majority of the time living with me, occasional weekends at her dad's), catch up on bills or do whatever, go to bed, rinse and repeat. It's a pretty shitty life cycle and I need to pull myself out of it or lose my mind (and my health). I feel I can only concentrate on one thing at a time and right now it's my job (takes a lot out of me, tbh).

I did my financial calculator and the earliest I can retire while still meeting my financial goals, seems to be at age 63. I know I need to see a financial planner but I guess I'm here wondering if anyone else has experienced this urgent feeling to just bail out of the rat race and take a chance on...living with less? Unlike many of my peers, I don't really derive enjoyment from working and I don't ""love"" my job. It's a means to an end and at this point in my life I'm not ""passionate"" about any specific thing, though I love to travel. I did a lot of traveling to crazy places when I was younger (Papua New Guinea, Nepal, Tibet, Galápagos Islands, etc) and I still love to travel though that's been on a back burner due to my unanticipated, not well executed divorce. Life has curve balls) . I do enjoy my coworkers which makes things more palatable - I just don't like the stress. My job comes with healthcare however, and I know how important medical coverage is and so I'm clinging to this job like it's a life preserver, for now, anyways. I actually think it's maybe the driving force that gets me up in the mornings.

My house is paid off and the market value (typically stable where I live and not really subject to downturns) is around $600K +. I have about $550,000 including savings/CDs/investment accounts/401K (not much, I know - but the fact that I wasn't working for 12 years, then had a part time job followed by a full time job (over a span of 5 years, neither of which came with any benefits) prior to landing this current job, means that my ""savings"" is pretty meager and I do realize this. I put 30% of my paycheck toward the 401K, and I've maxed out my FSA at $3500. I don't carry any credit card balances and I don't live extravagantly - though I don't live frugally; I just...kind of exist right now. I did return from a vacation earlier this week and am thinking hard about what I want to do with whatever time is left. My dad died at 60 from colon cancer and I've got some hypertension going on right now (weight gain and general stress are contributing factors).

I sometimes feel (a lot of the time) that I won't be able to sustain my workplace pace. I know I have to get an action plan together but I always feel so exhausted and my executive functioning is about maxed out as well, since I put all my energy into my job and all self-care and personal items take a back seat. I suppose I need to make an appointment with a financial advisor so I can ""map out"" what my future will look like and to what degree of control I have over it.

Honestly, I think I'd prefer buying a little place somewhere in Portugal, Spain, or Italy (I'm American, in the USA) and maybe getting access to healthcare over there which wouldn't cost me and arm and a leg, and just living life quietly....though I'm not sure I have enough to do that and/or if there's anything at my age (or 2-3 years from now) that I could do, money-wise to support myself.

I've rambled a lot and it's time to go to work. Anyone else understand what I'm trying to say? The nutshell I guess, is that I don't want/need a lot to live on (barring sickness which I know is a major gamble), I just want ""enough"", and unsure if I absolutely need to stick with my decent paying job now and tough it out for 3 more years, or bail and try to get a lower stress job (which might simply be trading in one type of stress for another)...

Anyone have any thoughts or can share their experience? Different paths for us all, I appreciate. Just wanted to share my circuitous life journey and how, at age 60, I'm not where I envisioned myself to be and trying to figure out how to get to a place that I've yet to define, mostly because I'm unhappy with the present.

Thanks for bearing with me this far....

**EDIT:**  Thank you everyone for taking the time to post thoughtful, insightful comments and suggestions. I appreciate it so much. This isn't my primary account - I created it on my desktop but then I was responding throughout the day from my phone which is why my responses were from a different account. Shoutout to u/bubbafry for pointing this out. I don't know if I was more concerned about general privacy or just feeling sheepish about my current state of emotional (and financial) limbo, but, I am really, really grateful to this community for the consideration and advice provided here.  It's the first time I've sought feedback like this and I am going to re-read all the posts this weekend. I actually love all the various perspectives and take some comfort in realizing that there really is not one pat answer - but maybe a mix of perspectives will help me hone my own and feel more comfortable figuring out a path. I really, really appreciate everyone here and want to thank you.

Knee surgery before/after retirement?,I am 63 and retiring at 65. I have decent insurance now. I do not know which would cost me more for knee surgery - before or after retirement. Thanks ahead for your responses.
"Thoughts on ""am I in a position to retire""","Homeowner in NYC, still owe a BUNCH on the mortgage, BUT  
Not counting a small pension, and Social Security I can:  
Sell the house.  
Buy a house where we intend to move (Western NY)  
Have NO other debt  
And have circa 1.3 million in Retirement funds   
My existing employer is willing to keep me on 3 days/week, full benefits (100% company paid platinum level medical) - but at a low hourly rate ($30 - works out to $37K/year)   


You guys think this is enough to retire at age 60?  We don't live an extravagant lifestyle - I day trip a few times a year, have gone to Europe ONCE in our lives

Thoughts?

Edit:

Btw, interestingly, I just got a job offer at a considerable increase from what I was earning before my hour cutback. Of course, there is the risk of a new position, and it would eliminate the whole “work from home in Western NY” (Rochester Area BTW). I have till Monday to decide, “Do I keep working, or Retire”
Why Rochester? Where my Daughter lives, where my Son goes to school. My daughter about to make us Grandparents"
Feeling Old…,Yesterday I got my Medicare card in the mail. Today I got an email from Medicare.gov entitled “How to Choose a Nursing Home”. I’m feeling quite ancient now…🤣
Funny exchange that made me feel old,"I was at the farmers market and my bill was $5.54. I handed the young (20ish) cashier a ten. Then I said “wait I think I have 54 cents”. I immediately started pulling out change (there was nobody behind me in line) and before I could get out the exact change the cashier looked at me and deadpan said “I already have the change out”. Then she proceeded to give me $4.46. I guess she couldn’t put it back in the register. Lol, she might as well have said “OK Boomer, cash is for old people”."
Has anyone taken on a roommate in retirement?,"I (62F) am nearing retirement in 2 years. I still have a mortgage but it’s very low relative to my HCOL area. I’m planning to travel quite a bit when I retire - with extended stays. I want to keep my house as it’s very close to my kids who are planning to have children in the near future. Since I live alone I’m thinking of finding a roommate for a bit company when I’m in town and to help with expenses when I’m away. I’m very independent with a large social circle but after the pandemic the house has gotten a little quiet and will probably be even quieter without work.  If i downsized I wouldn’t really save any money as prices have increased a lot. I would have to leave the area to come out ahead which I don’t want to do. I can manage financially without a roommate; it’s something I’d like to do. 

Has anyone been in my situation? How did things work out? Pros/cons?  Advice?"
Not rich,"My (62M semi-retired) wife (52F Fed employee) used to think having $10,000 in the bank is enough to retire on! A few years back, I had her sit down and write out all our bills for the month and give me a number. She sobered up real quick. Nice little exercise for the people in your life."
"Mother retiring soon with death benefits from workers compensation and survivors benefits from Social Security, what would the offset be?","Hi, my mom will be retiring soon.  My father died in the job when I was 5 (about 17 years ago) and she has been collecting Workers Compensation death benefits ever since.  She plans on taking my father's social security benefits upon retiring, as he made much more than her.  Does anyone know how much the offset will be for taking both of these?  I know there will be one, but I can't find the appropriate documentation online to figure it out myself.

Thanks!"
"Schwab, Fidelity or Vanguard? Which one do you like and why?","I am moving on from my financial advisor and company.   I am thinking about managing my funds myself for the first time.

Rule of 55,"My husband is 53 and has been at his job for 30 years. If he leaves at 55, I believe the rule of 55 would apply on his 401k.

So, does that mean he should leave it in his work 401k? He shouldn’t rolls it to an IRA?"
Financially illiterate spouse,"My husband will be 65 in a few months. He's taking a leave of absence shortly to test out retirement.  I'm 5 years younger and will probably leave my job before year end. I carefully manage my retirement portfolio, and brokerage account and can tell you how much and where everything is. My husband does not know how much he has for retirement, does not know how many accounts, let alone the return. He shrugs when I ask. He keeps more than a years salary in his checking account, he doesn't like to ""thinking about money"". I managed to get him to open a roll over IRA, and he says that was a mistake because the market went down. He does not understand long term investing. He literally would be the man with money under the mattress. 
Does anyone else have a spouse who is financially checked out? I'd like to think it's his problem but at some point I'm worried I'll pay the penalty for his lack of planning. I think his portfolio is half the size of mine."
What should we be saving for retirement?,I had some time out as a stay home mom so have been working hard to save in my 457b but have to pull back now as have lots of upcoming costs on our home.When I go online it suggests that by 50 we should have 5 times your salary by 50. I am nowhere near that. I will get a teacher pension and worked out it will be about 35k by 60 since I will have less than 20 years service. I reckon after mortagage is paid off I need about 50 k to love on. Are peole really saving this much in their 401k/457b?
How do you deal with otential long term projects before you give notice?,"A little off topic.  I'm targeting a retirement date near the end of September, so roughly two months. I work in Tech. There is a particular upcoming project that will span many months, and will require significant training, etc.  I'm being asked to be the point person. I guess I should just play dumb and go ahead, but it seems a bit foolish to have them relying on me as the main tech resource when I know I'm going to leave in 60 days. (Plus...I really don't want to have to go through all of the shit learning this stuff for no reason.)  But I can't exactlyt say, ""Hey, you should have Bill spearhead this because I'm gonna be out of here.""

This is a modest sized company and not a lot of overlap, so it's not like there will be 2 other people learning this stuff. It'll just be me.  (Plus, did I mention that I really don't want to do this?) 

Forge ahead? What choice do I really have?

Okay to Proceed with House Purchase Plan,"Hi there!  Before pulling the trigger - I thought I'd throw out my plan for purchasing a house and see if others agree this is an okay way for me to proceed.

I am fortunate to have been able to retire last year at the age of 55, after 30 years of service in a state govt position.  I'm now receiving a defined benefit pension of $8,600 monthly, after taxes.  A solid health insurance plan is included at no charge for spouse and I.  Spouse is 53 and also stopped working last year, although may return to work in the next year if needed.  Spouse will receive a defined benefit pension of $1,200 monthly in seven years (age 60).  I am currently not eligible for social security as I'm 11 quarters short; however, even if I did pick those quarters up, I'd still be subject to the windfall provision act and my check would be reduced a lot.  Spouse will be social security eligible; however, also subject to windfall provision and earnings from jobs have been much smaller.

I sold the house earlier this year and moved to another state.  We have zero debt and I have $460K in 403b and $310K in proceeds from the sale of our primary home earlier this year.

Would it be okay to use all of my 403b savings (except for saving $50K for emergency), for the purchase of a $730K home?  Using the rule of 55, I would take out the withdrawals over three years to ensure we stay within the 24% tax bracket.  And the home would be paid off in 2027.

Since my monthly pension of $8,600 after taxes seems to be sufficient to fund living expenses including travel, which is our passion/hobby, it doesn't feel like I need to hold onto the 403b funds for anything better than a nice home for us to enjoy.  I welcome your reactions, thoughts and suggestions.

Finally went to see a true financial advisor about retirement,"Spent my lunch hour talking to a financial advisor.  Me (55m) and my husband (64m) are both government employees with a pension.  I will retire in 5yrs and I want him to retire next year.  He also has a 401k with his previous job working at a major hotel (236k).  His pension will be about $3500 a month and he also has a 457 plan with about 370k.  We’re debating whether he shouldn’t take his Social Security now or wait.  We still have a mortgage and owe about $600k (home in San Francisco).  Not much in bills but we love to travel.   I am looking to retire in 5yr since my pension will likely be around $8100.  My 457 plan is about $410k right now and I have a Roth and a few other accounts totaling over 100k.

Good news is that my husband can retire and we can continue to live the same way we do now, with most of our expenses going to mortgage and traveling.  His health is ok.  He did have a triple bypass a few years ago so I do worry about his health.

We didn’t do a deep dive yet with the finance guy because it was just an introductory meeting.  Still big question is whether to keep the home in San Francisco or sell.   We do want to spend a lot of time traveling the world.    Would renting a place overseas and selling the home be our best bet.  Also, How much should I expect to sock away for medical if we stay here in the US.  We are both covered for medical after we retire.  But we are more concerned about having health issues and then having  to be placed in a home where it would cost us $10k / Mo.  

Any retirees have any insight or advice?"
Is it just me ... or do annuities suck?,"There are so many shady offers for annuities out there. If you have even the slightest knowledge of investing, isn't it better to hang on to the funds and direct them yourself? Do you really trust any given company to handle a huge chunk of your hard-earned capital and pay out over the years ... will they always have your best interest in mind? I don't think so. Open to opinions. As always, maybe it makes sense for some but not others."
Planning calculators,"My wife and I are planning to retire in 6 years.   I will be 61 and she will be 60.   We are thinking about renting our house out and have some smaller investments that would allow us a monthly budget of 3500.   
She would probably get SS at 62 and I would wait until 67 depending on our health.  

We are would like to live in another country with a lower cost of living for at least 5 years for a little adventure and to let our investments grow.   I am wondering if anyone has seen a retirement calculator that allows for different scenarios like I described."
To get a dog or not?,"I know this isnt as big a retirement issue as money but here goes - we plan to retire in about 6 years. Our current dog is old and we will probably have to put her down in the next year or so. The problem is I know my wife will want another dog. Problem is I dont want a dog going into retirement because we will want to travel alot and I dont like to have any pets to worry about.

Any thoughts?"
Roth vs Traditional - Does it Actually Matter??,"Hi All, hoping to get some answers from those who have successfully retired.  Thanks!

It's common knowledge that pre-tax contributions are better if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket at retirement but I want to know does it actually matter? 

For those who have retired, do you go back and figure your tax bracket (marginal rate) when you contributed funds vs what they would be taxed today or do you not really care or would you rather look at your retirement account balance and know what's there is yours (as in Roth) vs wondering what the taxes will be?  

Also any pre-tax funds you pull out may affect social security taxes and Medicare deductible.  If you could go back in time and re-contribute, how would you break up pre-tax, after-tax and Roth contributions?"
CFP for personal use,"I am turning 62 soon and have been interviewing Financial Planners and have not found one that I’m will to pay 1% of my assets.  This could tens of thousands per year.  Instead I am considering studying for the CFP exam and using that knowledge to manage my own finances.  I’ve been fortunate to save enough to retire this year.  My wife will work for another 10 years and she make above average earnings so we could be okay.

Has anyone here taken the classes and exam for their personal use?"
Live off of guaranteed income or retirement accounts first?,"When we hit 62, our social security and pensions, and the pensions have c o l increases, combined will be more than what our take-home pay is now. In addition, our house will be paid off at that point.

My thinking would be to take the SS and live off of those guaranteed funds and leave our 401k and ira money sitting there. Dip into those only if needed for unexpected expenses, or occasional extra travel. 

My health is not great so I want to take my SS at 62. Partner in better shape and planned on waiting. Our health insurance will be covered through my gov pension, which I know is a huge blessing.

Am I looking at this wrong?? Been following this board and I keep seeing to figure out what your expenses are and how you will cover them. It would seem to me the best way to cover them would be with guaranteed income.

I know there are tons of other things to consider, but is this approach even one that is often used? Advisor at first look said we have ample in retirement accounts so should draw off of those and collect social security later. I can't wrap my hand around that.

Help!"
Move brokerage account?,"Hello, I have my retirement and other investments with Wells Fargo. I’m not super unhappy but I do think I am paying way too much for managing my investments — about .80%. Should I move to Fidelity or Vanguard? I don’t get any tax advice and the accounts sort of run in their own. My only complication is that I need to take a yearly RMD, which is probably not much of a complication.

Thanks in advance!"
I am clueless and don't even know what help I need--but I do need help.,"First, let me just get it out there that although I'm an intelligent person, financial matters are and have always been a struggle for me. Beyond the basics of checking/savings and paying bills, things start getting murky for me. I can't even competently explain how the finer points of my mortgage work.

Early in my adult working life, I had a 401K through my employer. I left that job and stopped contributing to the account. I got a new job with a new and completely different 401K option (or something like it? Called a SARSEP, I think?). I left that job and stopped contributing. I had a lot of life turmoil after that, was broke for a while, and then went to grad school (I do not have loans or debt from that, hooray). I have since been employed by a school district, which gave me the option of having a 403B plan, so I opened one of those, but stopped contributing after about five years because...more life turmoil. When I was ready to start contributing again, the district said they were no longer going to send payroll deductions to the plan I had with AIG (was Ing before that, I think); rather, I had to open a new account with the only provider the district was going to work with. Instead, I did nothing.

Then, 13 years ago, I along with every other district employee, got a letter saying that we would no longer have Social Security deductions taken out of our pay because we were all being enrolled in the state's pension plan. My head was spinning. We had a big employee meeting with the pension people who explained that because at that point I already had so much time in the Social Security system, when I retired, I would get both SS and pension.

Now, I am l likely to lose my job on September 30 as the grant that funds the very niche position I've held for a long time is sunsetting. I'm 62 years old, and I'm panicking. Maybe I can get another job with the district, maybe not. Maybe I can find a job with another organization that's also in the state's pension system, maybe not. I can probably get unemployment for a while, although that system in my state is absolutely dysfunctional right now. 

I have few assets beyond this mess. Most of my savings were depleted caring for my mom during the last five years up until her death at the end of July. My husband and I have a house, but we still owe on that and likely won't pay it off for another 10 years.

All this to get to my question: Who is it I need to talk to to tell me what to do at this point? What kind of professional do I need? I literally have no idea how to access my retirement accounts when the time comes, nor do I know if I can combine them or roll them into something else. I'm trying to get my retirement ducks in a row, financially speaking, but I honestly don't even know who I need to talk to. Financial planners seem to all either want to sell me something or, if a fiduciary, charge me thousands of dollars that I absolutely do not have. It feels like the clock is ticking and I'm frozen in place because I don't know what I'm doing."
Is Term Life Insurance a good option for us?,"My spouse and I (60 and 50 y.o.) are preparing for retirement. My spouse is still working, but I am taking a break due to health issue. If I do go back to work, I might just get a part time/temporary work, so I will have opportunity to spend time with our relatives who are overseas. On the other hand, my spouse may want to retire when he hits 62.

We do not have any children, thus our lives are pretty simple and frugal. Therefore, we did not consider to get life insurance before. But now, when we are closer to retirement, we are thinking we might miss buying term life insurance for my spouse.

First we thought, though we are no rich by any means, but financially we should be fine. We have rental income which will cover most (I would say around 80%) of our living expenses. We also have around $12K/year dividend income . So, our passive income should be able to cover our expenses. Besides that, we also plan to get my spouse annuity withdrawal once hitting 65 y.o. And later will file for Social Security Income when we reach full retirement age.

Since we are still debating if we should move closer to our families and relatives in overseas when we are older, thus we did not get long term care insurance. Besides that, many friends shared with us their struggles when they claimed LTC for their parents. But now, I am thinking maybe getting a term life should be a good option for my spouse, so just in case, if his final years out of medical bills are high, I could get some relief when I get the insurance payout. But we are debating since it may be a high monthly payment. Should we just use that monthly installment to invest in stock market instead, for example just get the SP500 mutual fund?

Thank you.

Edit for final decision:

Thank you for the knowledge and tips shared! After considering all the responses here, I would think it is better for us to use the money to pay the monthly/annual premium, it would be better for us to invest it in the mutual funds. I really appreciate your time to help. "
Rolling 401K to IRA Fidelity or Vanguard? Any thoughts.,
Pre-Retirement (When?),"61yo s/m. $150k left on $200k mortgage @2.5%, car loan $36k@2.9%, no other debt. Currently living off $5k/mo. $505k n 401k, $160k n IRA w/another $50k in cash saved. When can/should I retire? Sooner the better…"
401k vs 457,I plan on retiring for 7 to 10 years in the Philippines then coming back to the United States. I have 11 years to go and plan on living off my wife's and my pension which should be around 5k a month. I am 44 now and I get no employee match plus I already max out my Roth IRA which I just started last year. Also paid off home if you had 1600 a month both have the same investments which one would you use 457 or 401k.
Reduce Pension or Buy Term Life?,"I am 60, wife is 59 (already retired) and I am weighing options on how to utilize my local government pension when I retire (hopefully soon). If I were to retire now, I would receive approximately 60k annually from my pension for the rest of my lifetime. My plan offers the option of reducing the pension amount by 20% and the payments would last through the lives of both me and my wife, which solves the issue of her potentially being in a difficult financial situation if I die early. That would be approximately 48k annually. With the difference so large, would it be better to take the full amount based on my lifetime and purchase term life to protect her? I am in excellent health (other than my knees). 

The longer I live, the less she will need (both due to receiving my pension and her death will be coming in less time). Is there a way to have series of term plans? Say a five-year policy for 300k, a ten year for 300k, a 15-year for 300k and a 20-year for 300k?  The five-year should be very cheap and they would get more expensive with each successive plan. As they expire, by the time I'm 80-ish I would only have the current 100k whole life plan I own, but she would be reaching 80 and have far fewer expenses. Just looking online, it appears to me that would be considerably cheaper to purchase term life like this rather than take the 12k annual hit and it would protect her economically much better. 

Background info, we have about a million in retirement funds and no debt. We've just downsized to reduce expenses. No kids, so we don't really have a strong incentive to leave a large estate (some nieces and nephews). 

Please feel free to critique my ideas and give me your expertise. There is quite a bit of great info in this sub."
Can I retire?,"I’m 37/m married to a 35/f. No kids and neither of us want any. We have a dog and he’s enough. I recently (within two months) started a new job making $230,000 base salary, with a minimum yearly bonus of 25% and $30k in company stock.

I’m also an Army vet that is 100% disabled and get $3,823.89/mo in tax free disability pay. This generally increases with cost of living each year. I did not retire, so no retirement pay. Being 100% disabled also grants me completely free health/dental/vision care. My wife gets free health care but has to pay deductibles. The cap for that is fairly low. Right now, she gets dental and vision insurance through my job. If I were to retire, we would have to pay for that out of pocket. 

We have a little over $400,000 in various retirement investment vehicles. Another almost $100,000 in liquid money in savings/checking. We also close tomorrow on selling some land we own outright for another $135,000 (after closing costs and taxes). 

We own a home that has about $25,000 left on the mortgage at 3.5%. It’s currently valued at ~$230,000. We just bought another house for $700,000 to relocate to my new job. The market in the new area has steadily increased, in the favor of sellers, and we actually got a pretty good deal on the place when we bought. 

We are going to be renting out our first house and making somewhere around $1,000/mo in rental income after paying the mortgage and rental company. The house was built in 2010 and has been kept up with very well. Recent roof, appliances, water heater, etc., so I don’t see any big ticket items coming due too soon, barring anything extraordinary. 

I’ve been told that with my disabilities I could apply for SSDI and “probably” get it, but that wasn’t from anyone of official capacity. The SS website estimates my payment would be somewhere over $2k a month. I’m not holding my breath on that or factoring it into the calculations I’ve done. 

We own our two vehicles outright, a 2016 truck and 2019 car. The truck has about 110,000 miles but still runs strong and is maintained very well. The car is really low mileage because she doesn’t drive it much. 

My wife hasn’t worked and doesn’t want to work. I’m completely happy with that. I’ve gotten to the point where I would much rather not work. It has been both of our plans to retire somewhere in the Blue Ridge Mountains. We are from the general area and have a lot of family within decent driving distance from that area. 

If we decided to retire, we would sell the new home and probably take a small loss due to taxes, closing costs, and other associated costs. The new job isn’t bad at all, but I’ve found myself daydreaming more and more about being retired. 

We would want to buy a decent chunk of land (5+ acres) outside of a good sized town, but close enough to easily get to grocery stores. We would build a nice house, probably around 2,000 sq. ft., but definitely not a McMansion type place. 

I have a master’s degree in my field, and I have seen several adjunct professor jobs where I could teach online at a much more relaxed pace, with a lot less stress. I figure if I couldn’t fully retire due to money constraints, maybe I could pad the coffers by doing the online teaching gig. 

I hope I covered all the areas to help you guys give me some good advice. If not, ask whatever questions you have and I’ll do my best to answer.

Edit: I was reminded I should consider our expenses. I consider them low, in general. Neither of us have an extravagant lifestyle. We don’t care about having the latest and greatest tech or fashion. Besides the standard living expenses of utilities and food, we would want ~500mb internet. Two cell phones. We pay $20 a month for a two streaming services. We don’t go out to eat a lot and aren’t the type that has to do fine dining. We don’t smoke or drink. We mostly enjoy nature, being around family and friends, and doing things around the house/yard. I’m sure being retired would be a lot of trying to find hobbies, which could get expensive, but both of us are great with creating and sticking to a budget. Our dog is starting to get older and he has a few medical issues that cost a bit of money every month, but we probably won’t get another pet for a while after he dies. I can’t really think of any other expenses we would have until one of the vehicles needs to be replaced."

Best path out?,"I am a federal employee (only 17 years). I have cancer and plan to retire the day I turn 65 due to medicare. My chemo is very expensive. 

I'd prefer to wait until FRA (66.5) but I am tired of the lack of respect and having to tell taxpayers that ""its not my call"".

Am I better off extending my employment with ""non pay"" HRA status as long as I can? I'll be 65 in October."
Bill Burr on Retiring,
Why and how do you guys assume money will last?,"I know the average time in LTC isn’t that long but what if it’s an extreme case and you and partner need help? Like, what percent of retirements have the worst possible LTC situation covered? The normal financial advisor says the house is the LTC coverage? Is that right? $300,000 at 40k a month isn’t gonna last when partner and you in Alzheimer’s care for 10 years? I just don’t get how any retirement plan can be like approved and certified. Since no one wants to talk about extreme LTC cases. Is it fair to say your kids need to get involved and either take you off meds or then put you in a Medicaid shithole? If no kids, what happens? Is it fair to say every retirement is just a Russian roulette situation? 1/7 heathy retirements end up penniless due to extreme cases of LTC care?"
Question,My father-in-law saw after covid he lost money in is 401k and decided to take out money. was this a huge mistake or not?
Taxes on Traditional 401k,"My son asked me a question that set me thinking. Suppose you put in $5k a year in your traditional 401k and you worked for 20 years you would have put in a total of $100k in your 401k. This amount would reduce your taxable income and would also grow tax free. Suppose that the savings stands now at $125k because of growth and suppose that you retire and start taking distributions from your 401k. The entirety of the distribution is taxed as ordinary income, not just the ""principal"" (the $100k) correct? But if I had invested in a regular investment account instead of a 401k, the 100k would be taxed as regular income (possibly at a higher rate than what I would be paying post-retirement) but the growth will be taxed only at capital gains rates which are lower than regular income?  So the only advantage of a regular 401k is that you save on paying income at a tax at a higher rate?"
How do you decide whether to hire or not to hire a financial advisor?,"I had a financial advisor or rather a broker.  My portfolio isn’t bad but fees are high.  Well, he resigned after FINRA fined him and suspended his license for 45 days…. (I didn’t hire him; my financial advisor retired and he took over my account.)

I am now looking at fee-only financial advisors, but I am not sure whether I need one  or not.   If I am going to put my money in ETFs, what do the financial advisor do to “actively manage” my portfolio for 1% fee of the asset?

Should I just hire one to set up a portfolio and, after that, hire them by hour as needed?

Or, just put the money in the target fund? 

I have about 8 more years to retire.  

Please share your experience and thoughts!   Thank you!"
How easy is it to roll over a 403b plan?,"I just finished reading ""I Will Teach You To Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi and learned a lot. I looked into our current financial advisor and learned that he charges a 1.25% fee. I now know that is high. I'm an educator, so in addition to my pension I contribute to a 403b. I'm thinking we should part ways with our current financial advisor and roll over the money into a Vanguard account, likely a target date fund. Does anyone have experience doing something like this? Will we have to pay fees if we switch accounts? Any words of wisdom? I can retire with my full pension in 9 years (if i can hang in that long), my husband will likely retire in 6 (not with his full pension because he didn't start teaching until he was 40.)"
where to get free financial advice for retirement.,"I'm getting close to retirement and feel I need advice on how to set up my finances. 

I don't have much money and will be depending on SS for retirement.  I have 3 small pension plans and a small 401k.

I don't have enough to add up to much, but I would like to maximize my retirement income."
How to find a good Fee only advisor...?,"I am getting close to retirement and am looking for a CFP and hopefully a fee only advisor. 

I have worked in finance for about 30 years and know enough to seek a second opinion when it comes to making major financial desisions. I have been looking for a CFP to draw me up a plan independently from the analysis I have done (my own spreadsheet, new retirement model, and a safe withdrawal calculator spreadsheet).

Most of the planners I have spoken with are both expensive (3K for a basic plan which would just be a ""new retirement"" like model) and don't seem very interested in managing my account (1.3MM in invested assets and a 3.3M balance sheet). 

If you have found either a good CFP or Fee only advisor how did you find them and how many did you interview?

Thanks!"
Back Door Roth IRA,"I have been told I can fund an IRA and then convert those funds to a Roth IRA every year. What are the pros and cons?  Any tax impact when I convert IRA to Roth? What about when I retire? FYI, my income is too high to contribute to Roth ""normally"".  I also max out 401k."
IRA contribution question,"If someone has not maxed out their 401k contribution for the year ($22.5k) and leaves their job. Are they still allowed to contribute to their IRA max ($6500), so long as the IRA contributions amount doesn't go past the max allowance ($22.5k)?"
Coming out or retirement and re-activating security clearance,"I hope I never do this but was pondering whether I should make some plans (I retire in late July -  52M) to have some verifiable record so I can prove I wasn’t locked up in jail or spying overseas, should I ever decide to re-enter the workforce in a field similar to what I do now.  

I’m not high level cleared and never plan to be.  Just DoD secret and GSA public trust (hspd-12 I think).  But I’ll tell you , those GSA people left no stone unturned and wanted employers and names of bosses all the way back the the 1980s.

But anyway, what’s a good plan for this?  Volunteer for some large bureaucracy like a school district, that keeps records and could satisfy the background investigators ‘someday’?"
Do I take SS at 62?,"Long story. Worked for a government program as a contractor for 35 years. I loved it but it was heavily taxing work on my mental health(abuse and neglect) the program announced out of nowhere it was ending a week ago. After the upset and panic, I have been pleasantly surprised at the mental space available to relax. I can continue to work in private practice if I want to. I am in good health but a breast cancer survivor (almost 19 years!) I have a good net worth and two rental properties. I will lose 1000 a month in monthly benefit if I don’t wait. I saw my 60s as me time, college tuition paid, so I can travel and do fun things but don’t know how to enjoy

Update:
Thanks for adding all the additional retirement tools.  The Vanguard tool does take into account historical asset allocation returns and inflation.

Reporting Roth IRA,"I have been contributing to a Roth for the last five years and report the contributions on turbo tax each year, when it asks. It seems to lower the amount of my return.

Please don't say these to your non-retired friends,"I am of the age where my friends are starting to retire. Without fail, they all add these two statements to their conversational repertoire, over and over:

- ""So, when are you going to retire?"" (usually after I said I can't do something because of work, but sometimes just out of the blue)

- ""I'm busier than I ever was!""

They don't mean it but these carry the connotation either that I'm a complete doofus for not retiring already, or they regret having retired and are trying to compensate. Either way, it gets annoying."

"Quick Question on Trad IRA, Roth IRA and 401(k)","Here is my situation:  


Married, both me and spouse <50years; I have a 401(k) plan which is maxed with employee matching, wife doesnt have a 401(k) at work, our MAGI in 2023 will be less than $112k (will be filing jointly)  


Could we both separtely open   
1) IRA for me  
2) IRA for wife  
3) Roth IRA for me  
4) Roth IRA for spouse  


Which one of these are possible and which ones are not. What are the individual limits for each?"
About to Retire and we have a plan that my wife suggested I swing past the Reddit,"Background:

Military retirement, E-7 at 20 years retiring in Georgia (sweet Georgia). Pension and disability that I reasonably believe that I'll get will be about $4,200 a month. There's a lot of reason to think my disability will come in higher but given a couple significant things I have on my record already we can be fairly confident in at least that amount.


Current minimum household budget is $4,100 and includes: mortgage, bills, utility, a ""more than ramen"" food budget, insurance, cell phones, internet, streaming services, etc etc. (As well as some allowances and extravagances that could cut down about $500 if necessary). If we had to cut it down to barbones we could probably make it $3,500.


I have zero interest in getting a job after the military, at least for a good amount of time for reasons so we're looking to reduce our overhead to a point where we can live reasonably with minimal to no additional work - or at least additional paychecks would enhance QoL instead of being required for it.


We've no recurring debts, regularly zero the credit cards, $100,000 that's liquid and a $40K Roth IRA that we completely forgot and also consider liquid (for reasons, despite penalty)


Our house is 16 years old and doesn't look like it's every had insulation redone, but we had the roof replaced with insurance 8 months ago.


This is also our last full year of military pay, no state taxes, married filing jointly with a standard deduction (which accounts for roughly a third of my gross).


Here's the situation; we are seriously considering cashing out the liquid account ($100K) and invest in spray foam insulation ($10k - supposedly cuts up to 40% of HVAC cost) and install a solar system with batteries ($55k. We've checked how our house sits and we've got a good location). 


Solar power system is slightly larger than allowed by Georgia for reasons and the math *should* work out to provide for more than our maximum energy usage on any given day, batteries account for half that maximum for overnight usage.


Reinvesting the remaining liquid cash in an S&P 500 index and the ""Oops"" Roth IRA would leave us with a year of ""better than ramen"" household operating costs - while still pulling pension and disability.


Here's the ask; what risks are we not considering? Is losing the earning potential of the $100K worth more than reducing our monthly and securing the stability? Is there a better place for our leftover ""liquid"" cash to get us back to not considering the ""oops"" Roth IRA?


Where are our blind spots?


Happy to answer any questions, I'm sure there's a couple


Edit - quick edit I forgot to add, looking at around $20K federal tax credits to further reduce our tax liability, and cashing out the liquid stuff shouldn't result in much capital gains for reasons.


Edit 2 - I feel there's lots of really good points being made here and we really appreciate it. I've been talking with the wife as we go so there's really good conversation *off* Reddit which I thank everyone for again. Big things so far: planning for inflation, ROI on the system, not as much equity added to the home, loss of potential earnings from the $100k liquid, concern with SS and 62-65 retirement, our budget being too tight to the minimum, and having to move/sell sooner rather than later, saving for maintenance, health care, and big purchase items like cars.


There's only a couple of those that I have really solid answers to: we also have a TSP that we left out of the equation as well as any jobs that we might get, and TRICARE Prime is 56$ a month. Everything else we have to add into our calculations one way or another"
Is 6 more months of a job I absolutely hate worth $300 per month in perpetuity?,"I work in public education administration, been doing the job of 2 people (at least) for years because well, public school. I was burned out even before Covid and now I’m just done. The state retirement system I have invested in will allow me to retire in December, 6 months before my official retirement date in June, but my monthly payments will be reduced by about $300 per month. If I stick it out till June I’ll get the additional funds. It seems like a no brainer, right? What’s 6 months when I have worked almost 30 years? But I’m just miserable.

A bit of a challenge for the members of this group,"I’m (69F) rolling fast to my next birthday and totally enjoy this sub. I don’t often post and my only experience with planning/architecture is real life: how to fix or improve the efficiency and comfort of the homes in which I’ve lived - on a budget. 
 
When I see the dream plans for 3,000 - 4,000+ sf homes I wonder what the current generation of dreamers would think of the ~1,400 sf house where my lower middle class family of 7 (parents and 5 of us “kids”) grew up. First floor: LR, DR, K. Second floor: 3 BR (*one* with a very small CL), 1 BA. If I knew how to post pictures/drawings/plans on here (*YES! I’m technologically challenged!!*) I’d show you, but you can undoubtedly imagine…

So… I’m curious to know where *you* grew up. Would you humor me?"
Covert to Roth and pay the tax ?,"I have $250,000 that is traditional 401K I have the option to covert to Roth and pay 37% tax this year. I’m 5 years from retiring and have a large bonus in Sept that I would set aside to pay the tax . I’m leaning toward NOT doing this and putting the bonus in mix of bonds / aggressive stock. Thoughts on the move. BTW the smartest people live on this site. I have learned a ton from all of you. So MAHALO !"
Medical coverage outside of US,"Does Medicare cover us in Europe for example, during a vacation?"
Zero tolerance for bad supervisors - time to retire?,"I feel like I just hit a wall at work. When I encounter a disrespectful person in a supervisory role, I just don't have it in me to deal with difficult personalities. Today I just took a mental health day and didn't work because this person was abrasive/rude/etc. (I work remotely). Wondering if this is what it's like before you retire? I don't recall being this way before. It's like a can no longer cushion the impact of difficult people or something. edit: I'm 57 and hoping to go until 62 at least."
RMD calculator? Is there a calculator that allows you to figure out your RMDs throughout your life given your current age and the amount in your 401K?,"I want to figure out if we can expect to face IRMAA in the future. If we do I would then like to figure out how much we need to convert to Roth in order to avoid IRMAA. It is a balancing act so I an hoping to run several scenarios. 

TIA"
Humble Brag,"Is there a top number of savings and/or retirement income where some on this sub won't consider **humble brag**?

I guess that I am baffled at the various comments shooting posters down simply because they have done their due diligence to save and all they do is asking for a gauge to see if they have planned well.  Perhaps, all they need is a little nudge to take the leap of faith and not derision.  Stop working and relying on what you have saved for a long length of time is a scary proposition.  My wife and I are still worried that we have not saved enough.  Ok ... it is just I. 😅

If you live a fantastic life by only spending $36k each year and only on your social security, that is AWESOME!  If you post that multi-millions (let's say $10-$100M), two mansions, a retirement home in Aspen, a yacht, your kids go to private schools, then I'm sure many will call you out.

Just like DNA, retirement is very different for each of us.

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: I agree with some of the responses so far.  This sub is a community built to help and celebrate retirement.  Have you noticed the number of responses and upvotes to postings that announce a retirement and the postings asking for help/advice?  Just noting ... that's all. Cheers."
Retirement Relocation Ideas,"Planning ahead for retirement. Seeking advice and opinions of others. Military background and have moved around some between the states and Europe. Passion for being outdoors and traveling. Once I do retire, my spouse will begin to work less. She has the ability to travel around and take shorter contracts, with break in between, so we intend to do this (within the US for a few years until she fully retires as well. We will be doing a lot of leisurely traveling between her contracts (both within the states and abroad. We’re interested in where to have a home base for the times that she isn’t working and we’re not traveling. 

I will have a modest pension from the military. Spouse will be earning a more than modest income. We would like to make that stretch so please disregard any extremely high cost of living locations. We’re not the city BIG city type but will entertain the idea of a moderately sized city that has restaurants/breweries/parks etc. 

We enjoy being outside; hiking, kayaking, camping. We rather eat outside on a patio versus indoors and appreciate dog-friendly areas. We enjoy sunlight and moderate temperatures. Initial states that are in consideration include: Washington, Wyoming, Idaho, North Carolina, Virginia, New Hampshire, and Vermont. If anyone can speak to these spots with more specific ideas that’d be great! Of course, we’re open to all suggestions. 

Suggestions don’t have to be tax free states (for income and retirement purposes), but is definitely a benefit.

Interested to hear back everyone’s opinions! Thanks."
Advice - IRA rollover to ROTH,"I’m not sure what subreddit this truly belongs in, let me know if there is a better one.

**EDIT(bolded):** I should have titled this **ROTH CONVERSION AFTER RETIRING**. We both already have ROTH accounts and max out each year while working.

I plan on retiring January 2024, will be 63.5 years of age. Current thinking, **post my retiring** is to delay SS for some time (not decided yet,) using brokerage account dividends plus wife’s still working income.

Question - I will have a sizable rollover IRA, would it make sense next year to **convert some amount of the ira** (for sake of conversation let’s say 100K) into my roth? I believe the answer to this is a resounding yes. If not then how much $ and why you would say more $ if that's your belief/experience? Basically, I am wondering what the best way to avoid as much, (I guess future), tax as possible?

For computation’s sake let’s say current combined income after 401k deduction is 150k, home paid off, so just standard deduction. **So if I take no salary and convert $100k from IRA to ROTH our combined would be similar to prior retirement.**

Some contexts as to why ask here. I have a very bad taste for financial planners due to me being an uneducated saver at the time and an Ameriprise CFP many years ago putting money into front loaded mutual funds 3-4% plus the yearly 1% management fee, maybe it was 2%? Once I realized just how much I wasn’t gaining from these “awesome mutual funds and fees” I saw the trickery. I wish I had known this Ben Franklin quote ***“An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.”*** Thanks to the internet, I’ve gained some knowledge and years ago I opened a Fidelity accounts and rolled it all over, a split of IVV and AGG and also a brokerage account that is full of dividend aristocrats, all of this being self-managed.

After understanding what a fine piece of thievery that CFP got away with, I have a hard time trusting my money to a person who likes to count other people money.

Believe me, I take any response here with a grain of salt, If I can’t trust some “professional guy” that I used previously, then why any of you that I have absolutely no relationship at all? Maybe someone with a similar situation? Convince me and thanks if you are truly being honest. Again, how will I know?"
Anyone retire due to medical disability?,"I'd love to hear from people that retired due to disabling medical conditions.  When most daily living activities and traditional retirement pursuits are not realistically possible, how do you fill your day?    Many on this sub have written about post-working disillusionment and the hiccups related to the newly retired identity.  How have you handled this when disability has rendered reading, volunteering, socializing, travelling, or pursuing avocational interests mostly impossible?  How do you cope with a disabled retirement life that is shallow and small?"
Annuity vs lump sum at 53,"I know it’s been asked before but I’d appreciate the sub’s perspective on the decision to take an annuity or lump sum.

I’m divorcing, I expect to lose my longtime corporate job within the next 8-12 weeks as a result of restructuring, and I’ll be selling the marital home and splitting the profits with ex within the next couple months. 

I’m eligible to take my pension now as an annuity at about $3000 per month. 

I can also let it sit (even after I get laid off) to see if interest rates improve the lump sum payout over the next couple years. The lump sum at the moment is $550k.

I am in a very high cost of living area. I plan to get another job to bridge the gap until retirement age. I can’t afford to buy a house outright with profits from the sale of the marital home, but it’s enough for a down payment. 

I will have 150k in my 401k after the settlement. 

What would you do?"
Is trying to increase net worth in retirement very common to self insure LTC,"My dad seems to be treating his 401k as money that doesn’t exist and he will never touch it. The only reason I can see him doing this is because he wants to self insure for LTC costs (he’s assuming if him and mom need it) it will be at 80+ out of curiosity,  how would he do that effectively? And is it common to be a poor mouth(I am on a fixed budget) to self insure or be prepared to self insure for 30,000 a month LTC. My guess is he will have around 1 million in 401k, small pension, $400,000 condo paid off when retired and wants to get it to 3-5 million to self insure. My gpa had a wonderful career and died penniless from Alzheimer’s  care  and they had to take him off his medications to finish him off, so this might have something  do with it"
Affairs in order checklist?,"I remember seeing on the Internet, a very concise list of things to do to have your affairs in order. It was not complicated and was reasonably brief. If anybody has that, can you please link it here. I probably saved it somewhere, but just can’t find it."
Medicare,"Hi all, I am 65 (retired last year) and hubby is  also 65. We recently had our birthdays. He is still working FT and plans on retiring at age 67. When he retires, he will have fully paid health insurance (as he does now; we are both on his plan) and a nice pension. 

We are so confused about Medicare Parts A and B. When we sign up for these? I believe Medicare will be the primary health insurance upon retirement then the company health insurance will be secondary. Is this correct? Will the Medicare only kick in upon his retirement? We have heard/read conflicting thoughts on when to sign up for both Part A and Part B. 

Can y’all please share your insight? Thanks!"
Newly Retired / Emotions,"Hey all...
So, I retired after 35 years at one job and I was someone that really loved it and had great self-esteem and satisfaction doing my job. It was time though and for the first two  months I was really loving it. And now, a kind of creepy malaise has set in and my sense of self-worth and feelings of joy and purpose seem to be gone. Have you experienced these feelings?  Are they going to go away and if so, on what day...hopefully this Friday ;-)
Seriously, is this normal at this point of my retirement?
Thanks 
Take Care

EDIT: Well, I just went through 40 comments and am quite frankly, overwhelmed. Thank you all! Your kindness, compassion and interest in my thread brings a tear to my eye and I am not kidding. I just want to let you know that I wish you all the best and I have absorbed all that you wrote and will be re-reading your comments, in fact.
Thank You and Take Care"
Will it be enough?,"We will have close to 2 million with no debt or mortgage when we retire. 

Anyone out there retired with the same numbers? How has it been for you?"
Retiring without a physical address issues,"Newly retired and we just sold our house. We've decided to travel for 6 months or so without a base and figure out what's next. The lack of rent or mortgage will give our budget an extra bump in available cash.

But Federal law says you must have a residential address to have a bank or brokerage account.

Has anyone dealt with this? I don't have family in the same state. Can I leave my ""residence"" as where I've been living without any mail ever coming there? I'm hoping bank, insurance, Medicare, etc., will allow a PO Box for mailing.

I understand the reason (money laundering) for this law, but it offends my sense of freedom. God forbid I was actually homeless and needed a bank account - the hoops they have to jump through."

Military Retirement: Colorado vs. Indiana,"My husband is going to be retiring next year from the marine corps and we’re trying to decide between Colorado vs. Indiana. 

We know the basics that Colorado will tax military retirement, no tuition help for the kids when they go to college and Indiana does not tax military retirement and has free state tuition for veterans children. Those were the biggies for us. 

My biggest concern with retiring to Indiana is we have young children and I don’t want them to be bored and us not have anything fun to do in the summers.

Which option would you choose and why?,"**Option 1**

Retire at 55 (15 years)

Cheap Holiday once per year, change car every 10 years, having to keep a close eye on where every penny goes for the next 15 years and in retirement but will not run out of money if smart

Retire at 60 (20 years)

80% extra income so less money anxiety over the next 20 years and in retirement, 2 holidays a year, change car every 5 years etc"
Next steps for savings and planning,"**Background Information:** 

* Male - 39, yearly earnings $129,000 + 17.5% bonus.  Female 38 - $94,000
* Current Retirement Savings excluding HSA listed below - $322,000
* Equity in home - $140,000
* Home loan balance - $250,000
* Home loan interest rate 3.2%
* Mortgage, taxes, and insurance is a monthly payment of $2,200
* Student Loan interest is around 6%
* No car payments.  Each car has about 5 - 7 years of life left.
* Retirement goal is to keep our current standard of living and travel.

Currently, I am maxing my 401k and Roth IRA. I have a small brokerage account worth $22k. I am adding $400 a month to this brokerage.

My wife has a FERS pension and is putting her 4% there and she is a below her 401k max contributing around 12% of her salary to her 401k, however we have been aggressively saving to pay off her student loans.  My wife maxes out her Roth IRA as well.

We have about $40k saved in a typical savings account which will go to student loans. She owes around $59k on the student loans.  Our plan is making the minimum payments on the student loans, which is around $600 + $1,000 per month (she does not want to deplete all the money as once) and hopefully pay off the student loans in 4 years.

I have an old HSA with around $9k in it. My wife and I now have a joint HSA through the VA, which we max out but have only had it for a year or so.

What else can we do?"

Looking forward too much to retirement it hurts,"Happy Independence Day to those who celebrate it. When I take time off from work, usually around a holiday like this, more and more I think THIS is what I need to do, permanently. I'm sure everyone is looking forward to retirement, but not looking forward to getting older. My plan is to get out while I can still enjoy it. Sometimes I wonder if I can take 5 more years."
Mixed feelings,"I’m incredibly fortunate to have the opportunity to retire (yesterday) according to my financial advisor. I’m 54(f); my partner 55(m) has been retired for about a year. 

I’m a teacher. It’s fucking hard. I don’t have any conception that I’m changing the world or making much of a difference. I’m excited to have the time and good health to travel and take it easy. I just can’t wrap my head around the fact that it’s ok to not work. 

The 3 things I’m trying to work out are:
1. The guilt of knowing I didn’t really do anything to deserve this. My husband inherited life changing money when his parents died; I just was lucky enough to marry into the family. 
2. I know once I leave, I will no longer have the work family relationships and connections. I don’t necessarily like or want to hang out with all my coworkers, but seeing how all the work friendships from my husband’s job have gone no contact since he left, I’m mourning that part of my life. There are a handful of people I love like family. I know relationships wax and wane through life, but I’m still very sad about that. 
3. The reality of aging. I’m getting older and it scares the fuck out of me. Retired people are old farts. So the only thing between me and death is my job. (In my mind). 

Anyway, thanks for letting me blah, blah blah. I have set a solid date of the end of next school year and my partner and I are excited to travel without restrictions. 
TL;DR: I’m excited to retire, but then I reside in my head."
Independence Day - retirement & notices,"I have been reading a bunch of retirement posts that suggests 90-180 days of retirement notice given to current employers. My thoughts are if you aren’t getting a severance or pension, why give more than a 2 - 4 week notice? 

You had plenty of time to organize your work affairs and transition out (you been mentally checked out for months), so why would an employer need to know more than 30 days in advance you are leaving the company? 

Move on with your dreams, life is too short to play mental games with your employer. 2-4 weeks is all the notice any company should be given before resigning or retiring."

Pension percentage,"I’ll soon be 52 and will be able to retire “30 and out”. My estimated monthly pension payment will be $2,400.

Retiring from the military soon and want to leave our final duty assignment…Is there a site/sub that can help figure out where we should live?,"We have one year before we will be kicked out of our on-base home.  Two mandatory things: international airport (the bigger the better) and climate. We’d like to sit outside a lot and garden. Also will want kids in the area, good school, etc. 

Things that don’t matter: location, as long as there is an airport we will fly where we need to be. Money. We aren’t filthy rich but we have enough.

We’ve thought Charlotte and Denver. Anything else?

ETA: We live in San Antonio now and don’t want to stay. While there are many positives, the heat kills many of the plants I enjoy growing, and the freezing December temperatures killed the rest of them lol. I’m looking for more moderate year around or at a minimum not such extremes. 

We will not be working after retirement. 

We do want easy international access via plane. I spent too many years living in areas where I had to drive 2 hours to get to a regional airport to fly to a hub airport to fly to another hub then to my final destination. I don’t want to do that anymore."
Bucket strategy BEFORE retirement,"If the bucket strategy is recommended as a way to protect investments during retirement, why isn’t it also recommended for the same reason BEFORE retirement or even simply as a general investment strategy?

I’ve only ever seen it mentioned regarding retirement."
"Withdrawing 4%, how?","Hello,
Just diving into the realities of retiring. One thing I am confused about is the withdrawal
 of funds once you do retire (or have to take your minimum). If your retirement account is in stocks and bonds (I.e. no cash) do you simply sell some of these for cash so it’s available for withdrawal? Is this where you stop reinvesting dividends so that there is cash to withdraw?"
NC Orbit,Have anyone requested a refund and how long did it take. I’m in a financial burden and I requested a refund last week. Hoping it doesn’t take a long time to issue the funds.
Retirement Angst,"I assume I'm not the only one with this thought.  I'm going to retire after the first of the year.  I'm a big wig at a small company (420 employees).  I'm past the ""approved age,"" my wife wants me to, my doctor advises me to, and although I really enjoy my job and get a lot of positive feedback, I'm terrified of becoming that ""old guy"" who doesn't support change, feels entitled, puts down young people, etc.  I've seen many people outstay their welcome.

I guess the question, which must have been asked hundreds of times, it ""Now what?""

We will have a good income, but we are not wealthy.  I have hobbies, but not 6 day a week hobbies.  I hate being outside in the hot humidity of where we live, but have kids nearby.  I'm worried about being bored, and dare I say it?  Useless.

I figure this must get asked 5 times a week.  What are the standard answers?

&#x200B;"
Living off 401K -is this the way to go?,"Retired 3 years ago @ 56 yo and take an annual withdrawal of 4% from 401K which I also rolled my lump sum pension payout into.  This pays all expenses with plenty leftover for travel and incidentals.  50% stocks & 50 % bonds earning an average return of 6.5%.  Will get a “raise” when social security kicks in at 65. 

Is staying with the 401K the way to go? I didn’t know about the strategy to convert into a Roth before retiring. I pay the taxes fidelity auto withholds when I withdraw.  I’ve been getting a tax refund annually since retiring.

It seems to be working fine for now but I wonder if it’s too risky to leave the funds all in one place even though it’s diversified.  Does anyone else do this or have suggestions to avoid any pitfalls?"

Is this a bad idea?,We are not looking to leave much if anything behind. Minimal $1300 mortgage is our only debt. May have a small car lease eventually if one of our paid for cars dies altogether. Husband has a decent pension. Is it a bad idea to dip into 401K beyond a certain percentage to put off filing for SS then pull back on withdrawals after reaching age for maxing SS?
Retirement Budget Categories,"Looking for any feedback on items/categories i might be missing from my retirement budget.  I put in some dollar values, but i'm not really looking for an amount to spend, but rather if i am missing anything else.  I planned in travel, savings, and giving, insurances, medical, etc.  Other than adding travel and hobbies, is there anything else I am forgetting?

My health costs will be low, as I am a military retiree.  I'm just under 55 and have my military pension, investments, and rental income.  My retirement income will exceed my expenses and afford me some funds to travel.  I'm presently working and just trying to convince myself to pull the trigger.  I have a decent job with a salary just under 6 figures, so i'm just adding to my 401k and Roth while deciding when.  I'm a cost analyst, so i struggle with analysis paralysis ...

"My wife and I both just retired from teaching after 40 years each. We have gone from doing things we HAD to do, to now doing things we CHOOSE to do. I wasn’t anticipating how free I now feel. How truly WONDERFUL!👍",
I am a fairly young man (24) I am looking for some advice,I am currently looking to start saving for retirement now that I have a stable job. I have the option of a 401k through work which I am going to start investing in fairly soon. I also want to open an IRA account but I’m unsure if I should go with a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. Does anyone here have a preference over one or the other and why? I’m just looking to be stable at retirement age. I appreciate any input!
403B,"Hey everyone, my employer currently provides 3% into my 403B plan, regardless if I match or not. I recently changed it for me to match per pay period 4% roth but no money is ever taken from my check. Do I need to do 3% pre tax and 3% roth?!?! I just want to contribute from my check but Roth doesn’t seem to be taking money out of my check. It is also set in semi-monthly."
Looking to open a retirement account,Would Fidelity or Charles Schwab be better for a Roth IRA?
401K,"Retiring and want advice of where to put my 401k should I move it from my jobs company where I can no longer add to it or should I keep it there.  Also, if I move it will I still get the match?  Please give your opinion and experience."
Retirement in Germany,My plan is when I retire to move back to Germany. The majority of my income/savings will be in the US only one a small amount will be in Germany. What is the best way to pay my bills overseas when all my money is in the states? Do  I need to withdraw from ATM for a feee and then deposit the money?
Simple investments,"My eyes glaze over when I try to figure out how to invest some money my husband and I have. So many opinions and options. We just want our money that is sitting in a savings account to be earning interest and guaranteed. From my understanding, a CD would be the simplest. But are there any other simple options? Please be nice. I am older and have no experience in any of this.

Update: Sorry for not being more specific! We are both near retirement in about 7 years. We have retirement funds already but a savings account of about $50,000 that is just sitting there, not earning any interest. We are not very risky (our retirement accounts invest in “low risk” stocks) but just want to do something smart with that $50,000 (or maybe half of it)."
What is your longest held stock/real estate/collectible holding,Cost of it then vs cost of it now would be appreciated
Retiring to Arkansas,"Looking at Hot Springs Village or Bella Vista in Arkansas to retire to. I value the golf courses and wondered if anyone here has any input on either or both properties?  Good, Bad. "
Nothing to do with retirement,"Here is a post that has nothing to do with retirement.   I got a day off and being home alone yesterday, I spent a blazingly hot Texas afternoon, relaxing and blasting  old high school/college jams, my headbanging, long hair-flinging  days (with a whole lot less hair now) ... being 17-19 again.  With the likes of Scorpions, KISS, Pink Floyd, Foreigner, AD/DC, Led Zeppelin, Chicago Rush, Kansas, ..., I used to crank them loudly, rattling my homemade speakers in my hand-me-down '70 Firebird.

It was quite a trip down memory lane!  I truly look forward to the day I can do this (enjoying the finer things in life such as great music) anytime of the day, everyday ... 74 months left and counting.

What were some of your high school/college jams or mixed tapes?

Edit: Perusing through the Net, I found this Chicago tribute band ... they are spot-on!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9\_torOTK5qc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_torOTK5qc) ... enjoyed them thoroughly. Their other [Chicago's songs](https://www.youtube.com/@LeonidVorobyevandfriends/videos) are fantastic.  Just don't let the world politics get in the way of the wonderful things music brings."
One Car Trial Period- give me your pros and cons,"About seven years before retirement, we bought a 2013 Mini Clubman for DH to drive to/from work-great gas mileage. I have a 2015 Subaru Forester- can haul the big dog, my craft stuff, we can travel with friends, etc.

Fast forward to this week. The mini has 170,000 miles and a rear head gasket leak-so we sell it to the garage manager, he will spend the money to fix it up and give it to his daughter in the military. (we were going to donate to charity). The Sube has 107,000 miles and is now our only car.

We are meticulous about maintenance schedules, oil changes, etc.

We each have our needs for a car- DH goes to Home Desperate a few times a week, I have guild meetings, mahjong, lunches with friends several times a month, and we both do pilates 3x a week, with a somewhat split schedule. DH has way more doc visits than I do.

What are your experiences being a one-car-retired-family? I'm willing to give it a go so we can save on insurance, not have a car note, etc.

Edit: Thank you all for your answers! I didn't say (probably should have) that we can call on Uber, we do share our calendars, but we also live in a part of Texas outside a major metropolitan area with zero, zip, nada public transportation. 

I think it will work out- I go on SS later this year, so if we do need another car, we afford to get a beater lowe's/home depot run truck for the husband and have the subie for 'nice'. "
Just 4 more hours of work. Retiring today.,"We only get one chance to write a post like this, so I figured I'd go ahead and let the world know.  After 45 years with the same company, today's the day!

(I'd written a wall of text about my monthly financials here but then thought ""who cares?"" and deleted it.  Anyway, I should be fine.)

Looking forward to a stress-free retirement to pursue my several hobbies, along with some world travel.  Tomorrow starts the new life.  Woo-hoo!!!  


Edited to add: THANK YOU everyone for your many congrats and kind comments.  Now I'm 30 minutes away and going to blow off early.  I figure I deserve 30 minutes grace after 45 years, right?  Honestly I could've left early this morning but have been having fun with emailing people and following this Reddit thread.  But now I'm REALLY gonna turn off my laptops and start my official retirement!  My wife is taking me out to dinner.  (Haha, getting into the retirement experience already, with a VERY early dinner.)  So no more following this thread ... at least until tomorrow.  Thanks again and bfn!"
Railroad Retirement annuity question,"The sum of my monthly annuity direct deposits (for the year) is considerably more than what's  on the 1099-R form used for calculating income taxes.

Did anyone retire from their full time job “in place”?,Sort of coast in to the finish line at work for a year or two before retiring?  What was your experience? Was it drudgery or fulfilling?     Asking for a friend who has about 20 months to go.
55+ Communities - stand alone homes in FL,"Hi:

Does anyone have any suggestions/info on 55+ communities that are stand-alone homes ( or separate townhouses) and not connected townhouses or apartment type complexes.  I am not interested in The Villages. I spent a couple of weeks visiting there and felt too claustrophobic plus no true shopping malls nearby.  Looking for something nearer the gulf coast. I currently live in southern CT near (not on) the coast...I need water to be within a short drive. Thx !"
Quick question,"Happy Friday!!

I have a friend in her late 40’s who wants to start investing for retirement. She originally thought she couldn’t afford it but I said she could start with 50 bucks a month and she said that was doable.

I’m thinking an index fund in either Vanguard or Fidelity would be the best option for her. What do y’all think??

Thanks and happy 4th!!"
Rental Property in Retirement,"Our investment person said when we retire we should keep our rental property for income. It is a paid off small home netting about 1k per month.

It is fine...when it is fine. But a bad renter, eviction process, major repair, increased HOA, etc. can quickly lead to not fine/hassle.

Do any of you still manage rental property in retirement? Pros and cons please."
Do you shop at thrift stores?,"If so, what do you buy there?  Do you shop at thrift stores mostly to save money or is it the novelty of the experience?"
"How to move Domicile, and establish residency in a new state (MN-PA) for state income tax purposes?","I have worked for 20+ years in MN and I am giving a 1-year notice of going on a phased retirement from next summer (then me 65, spouse 64). I get to work on a reduced workload (0.33 to 0.67) for up to 3 years on a reduced salary but full medical coverage. After reading all the joyous posts of those who retired, I too decided reluctantly to discover a world outside of work (academic). For 3 years, I will be working remotely from PA state. We will put our house on the market next May and move to PA and initially stay in a rented place for a year. My worry is that MN will not let me move my ""domicile"" to PA by insisting on me having to pay taxes which will be deducted at source by my employer in MN. PA is going to require me to pay taxes on wages in PA because we will be living there. There is no tax agreement between MN and PA, and I thus likely not get any credit for taxes paid in MN. Is my only option to pay taxes in both states for the 3 years that I am planning to work part time remotely while living permanently in PA? Has anyone gone through the process of trying to avoid being taxed by former state even after you move out? How did you resolve the issue?

Retirement planning - how much do you spend on travelling?,"For those of you who have retired - how much do you spend on travel per year, and what does it buy you? 

How do you enjoy travelling? 

Do you travel in style or go low budget?

Has the desire to travel reduced in retirement?"
My Mom’s Retirement. Advise appreciated!,"It is truly an exciting time because I am finally getting to watch and help my mom retire. 

My mom has been a hard working employee from 16 to 62 and if that is not enough, she has battled with cancer (successfully!) for greater than the past 10 years. With retiring at 62, as I am sure many of you know she will receive social security but no health benefits until she is 65. These pretty much offset each other financially. 

However my mom is not impoverished, she is not well off either. She does have just enough money that she does not qualify for the government assisted healthcares in that category (that I am personally aware of, but could be mistaken). 

Does anyone have any recommendations of programs or different types of assistance that can help get her healthcare at a reasonable price? 

Any help on this is more than appreciated, thank you in advance!"
How to make extra cash while retired.,"Due to medical issues I had to retire early, so my pension is only $4,000/mo. That plus a divorce has set me back financially quite a bit. I tried working part-time job but couldn’t do it physically. I am thinking about selling my car and emptying out the little in my 403b. I did get a roommate so that helps. Any ideas on something I can do from home to make some extra income? I’m a retired educator. I do own a small home, thankfully, however that one’s with extra costs as well. Ideas??

*** OMG!! I don’t know why this is tagged NFSW! Didn’t even know what that meant and how to change it!  🤦🏻‍♀️"
Mindful of other’s time after our retirement,"This is kind of a sad story but teaches us a helpful lesson. 

I recently found out that the pharmacist at our nearby go-to pharmacy finally left the job and perhaps the field as well. Not too long ago, he had shared with me during one of my visits to pickup a prescription that he was extremely frustrated with many of the retired folks wanting to engage in extended pointless conversations when they visited. He mentioned at the time that he will probably leave the job and the retail pharmacy field. He had two young kids and he probably paid the price for being too nice because others couldn’t understand the value of his time. 

This is a busy pharmacy but he made it a point to even help customers find over the counter stuff from aisles outside. For someone like that to leave for such reasons, made me think about how easy it is for us to sometimes forget that while we may be able to enjoy the retirement at a certain point in time, many others we deal with are busting their ass trying make a living and take care of their families. They are measured for their productivity and we should be mindful of that.

Edit/Update: 
1. A number of responses suggest that the pharmacist somehow had other reasons to leave or that he needs to Up his social/public skills etc. While I can't claim to know the facts beyond what he shared with me, I do know that he was a friendly and professional. If the argument is that it is alright for people to be inconsiderate to workers and it is worker's job to learn to deal with it, sure that kind of explains why good workers may not last in certain professions because people won't learn to be reasonable and considerate.
2. One of the responses mentioned that a grocery store in Europe has a dedicated lane for chatty customers.

Pension question,"Wife and I (52/53) getting ready to retire. Both of our pensions ( totally different companies)were discontinued years ago but we are both vested for a certain number of years. According to our pension plans there are just 3 things that affect our pensions….
Years of vested service(doesn’t change)
Date of separation (end of month)and first date of following month (benefit commencement date)
Final avg earnings.  Figured yrs ago when pensions ended. 

We have a retirement “modeler” on our corporate website on the HR site. You plug in your date you wish to leave and it runs all your numbers and spits out your monthly benefit. That’s supposedly the ONLY variable. Your separation date. 
I ran a modeler last year about this time for a separation date and saved the results. I ran the exact same date recently and the monthly payment was about $200/month less. What gives?  My wife called her plan and they blamed the rise in federal rates for the decrease in her pension. It works out to about $375 less per month both of us combined. 
Is this legal?  Seems to me that their pension funds have taken a hit on long bonds and they are passing along their pension shortfall of funds to us. 

Can they do this?"
Taking 4% of retirement savings for how long?,"Still new to the financial side of retirement planning, so go easy on me ...

Hypothetical: if I have half a mil (after taxes) in retirement savings, and take 4% a year, that's 20k a year. Say I live in Portugal, where I'm required to have less than that in passive income, it's enough to live on, and I enjoy state-sponsored medical care.

If I retire at 62, that $500,000 is gonna last me 25 years, and I'll be 87 (if I live that long).

Not saying this is my plan, but if it were, what am I'm missing? Retiring at 62 on half a mil seems like it shouldn't be possible.

Thanks, folks.

Retirement Home And Wiping Out Nest Egg,"I’m (60M) thinking a lot about retirement since I turned 60. I’m a few years away but one of the things I wonder about is, how can I protect assets (home, investments, savings) in case I have to go into a nursing home later in my life? Is Nursing Home insurance worth it? Are there other approaches?"
At what age do you get rid of most of the physical stuff (aka declutter)?,"For most people, how long they live is uncertain but what is certain is that most of the stuff we gather needs to be cleaned up by someone at some point. To the extent possible, we would want to do things in a balanced way such that we are able to enjoy the things we have till the end but also be mindful of the fact that what we keep till the end will be our kids' responsibility to sort out and clean up after we are gone.

I can imagine that if we moved to a different place and especially if we downsize, it may be one big opportunity to start that process. As of now, we still have tons of stuff from our kids' childhood that hasn't been touched in years.

How do people go about this? Are we thinking it all wrong?"

Bank for retirement,What is the best bank to have your retirement check go to? I ask this because when I was trying to get my years in to retire in a state system management was accessing my bank transactions to make my last 10 years very rigid.
Planning early retirement (57),"At 57 yoa, I am planning on retiring from my job working in law enforcement.  I believe I will be ok, but wanted to get some feedback from you guys as well.  

My pension will be looking at $84k a year.  My 457B will have an estimated balance of about $1.2 million assuming a 5% ROR and continued contributions between now (43) and my retirement age.  My department hasn't quite jumped on the band wagon, but we are also looking at medical benefits for life upon separation which is going to be huge.  Multiple other departments have done it so mine is sure to follow which will be a pretty significant help.  At 62, I'll qualify for SS benefits as our department elected to pay into it year after year.  Won't be much, only like $30k or so. 

Bills wise, my house has a low payment and will be paid off by the time I'm 65 anyway and no other real outstanding debts.  Kids college fund is still going and separate.  Money will support my wife and I , who will have her own 401k which I'm guessing will only be about $300k.  

Outside of occasional travelling and fishing trips, don't really plan on having an extravagant retirement.  I'm looking at the paper and it seems that between pension, draws, and SSA I'm going to be making more money per year than I'm making at the moment.  

Based on the information I have, would you guys feel comfortable retiring at this point or is there something I'm missing or not taking into consideration. "
"Decision of when to retire has little to do with how much you've saved for retirement, report finds","Rings perfectly true in my case.  Maybe som bits of wisdom for those considering retiring soon.

The money quote:

    Retirement is more about having the financial house in order by paying off debt and scaling back lifestyle than reaching an asset target"
At what point do you stop checking the market every day? (Multiple times),"I retired just a little over a year ago in my early 50’s.   I was an active saver and for the most part managed my own investments.   I have a detailed retirement financial plan and withdrawal schedule that, based on pretty conservative market assumptions will well outlive me by a lot.   So there’s no reason for me to worry about running out of money.   

However, I find I check the market multiple times a day.  Check my portfolio multiple times a day.  I just can’t seem to stop it.    I have a busy life with other things so I’m not sitting at home watching the screen but I just can’t stop checking the market and if I’m honest with myself it causes me some stress.  

Is this an issue for others?   How do you deal with it? Does it go away with time?"

A Co-worker Passed Away,"A guy I've worked with for years died this past Sunday.  He lived in a different state, so we never met in person, but we talked pretty frequently on the phone.  I came to regard him as a friend.  He was only 63; just a little older than me.  It has made me think more about the fact that you just never know when your time is up.  I don't know many details, but it must have been unexpected because he never mentioned any serious health issues.  Strangely though, when we discussed retirement, he would say that ""I'm going to work here till the day I die.""  I know he was joking at the time, but those words keep ringing in my head.  The whole situation just has me feeling down (and more determined than ever to retire sooner rather than later.)

American Financial Education Alliance (AFEA) legit?,"My friend sent me a flyer in the mail regarding retirement planning courses offered by AFEA. It appears that there are different ""chapters"" offering courses in a variety of locations. Topics include: Taxes, SS, Medicare, and income planning. The are a 501 (c)(3), but I don't know if this fact protects me from the dreaded time-share-type sales pitches.  

The flyer states that the ""course"" is free; however, the time of the class is one evening from 6:30-7:30. My guess is that this is an intro meeting in which you will end up in panic mode ready to sign up for the actual courses on each subject area---for a handsome fee, of course. 

I need help with retirement planning, but I resist the help because I am so very pessimistic and cynical. My guard is up continually, and I don't want to get ripped off. I'd appreciate any information about this organization. Thanks so much! "
advice on retiring at 62 when spouse still works F/T,"As the title says, I (F/62) am no longer working and my spouse (M/63) is still working full time.  I have a small pension/retirement from my previous job of 18 years.  I am considering taking that pension and my social security now, as I don't plan to look for another job.  I've read about Illinois law on taxing of retirement funds and also know that this income for me will be taxed at my spouse's rate.  What are the thoughts on filing separately - is that a good option?  Or is it better to file jointly and get those deductions.  I'm wanting to see what unintended consequences we could face if I do retire early.  Thanks for your input!"
Younger spouse still working?,"I’ll be 65 early next year and will probably retire before the end of 2024. My wife is ten years younger and carries our health insurance through her job.

Anyone go through a similar scenario?"
